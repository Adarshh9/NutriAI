The data of 320 patients with renal calculi and an eGFR\u2009<\u200960 mL/min/1.73m2 who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) at Zhongshan City People\u2019s Hospital from January 2018 to June 2023 were retrospectively analyzed; 164 patients were treated with MPCNL, and 156 were treated with SPCNL. The clinical efficacy of the MPCNL and SPCNL regimens was compared in terms of stone-free rate (SFR), renal function change, hemoglobin (HGB) drop and other complication rates (complications were classified by using the Clavien\u2012Dindo system). The SFR was 67.1% in the MPCNL group and 67.9% in the SPCNL group (P\u2009=\u20090.867). The overall eGFR of the two groups was significantly improved at 1 month after the operation (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Postoperative renal function was stable, improved and worse in 50.0% (n\u2009=\u200982) vs. 53.8% (n\u2009=\u200984), 39.0% (n\u2009=\u200964) vs. 42.4% (n\u2009=\u200966) and 11.0% (n\u2009=\u200918) vs. 3.8% (n\u2009=\u20096) of the MPCNL and SPCNL patients, respectively, compared with preoperative renal function (P\u2009=\u20090.053). In addition, the overall postoperative complication rates between the two groups was not significantly different (P\u2009=\u20090.103). Patients who underwent MPCNL had a lower transfusion rate (7.9% vs. 16.7%, P\u2009=\u20090.017) and shorter hospital stay (4.57\u2009\u00b1\u20093.14 vs. 7.16\u2009\u00b1\u20094.05 days, P\u2009<\u20090.001) than those in the SPCNL group. MPCNL and SPCNL have positive effects on the treatment of renal calculi in patients with renal insufficiency; both have acceptable SFRs and complication rates, stable or improved renal function in most patients.",

    "content": "Nephrolithiasis (kidney stone disease) continues to pose a significant global health challenge, affecting millions of individuals and placing substantial economic pressures on healthcare systems. Traditional diagnostic methods\u2014such as computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, and basic urinalysis\u2014are often limited by issues including radiation exposure, lower sensitivity in detecting small stones, operator dependency, and the inability to provide real-time analysis. In response, electrochemical sensors have emerged as innovative and powerful tools capable of the rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of key biomarkers associated with nephrolithiasis. This review highlights the advances in electrochemical approaches for monitoring oxalate and uric acid, the two primary metabolites implicated in kidney stone formation. We discuss the principles of electrode design and fabrication, including nanomaterial integration, 3D printing, and molecular imprinting, which have markedly improved detection limits and selectivity. Furthermore, we critically evaluate the practical challenges\u2014such as sensor fouling, reproducibility, and stability in complex biological matrices\u2014that currently impede widespread clinical implementation. The potentials for miniaturization and point-of-care integration are emphasized, with an eye toward continuous or home-based monitoring systems that can offer personalized insights into risk of stone formation and progression. By consolidating recent findings and exploring future trends in multi-analyte detection and wearable diagnostics, this review provides a roadmap for translating electrochemical sensors from research laboratories to routine clinical practice, ultimately aiming to enhance early intervention and improve patient outcomes in nephrolithiasis.",

    "content": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) represent a leading cause of premature mortality and disability worldwide, with their incidence expected to rise, potentially reaching 24 million deaths per year by 2030. These multifactorial diseases, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, and heart failure, are often linked to metabolic disturbances such as diabetes, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation. Natural compounds, such as caffeine, have been explored for their potential therapeutic effects on CVDs. Caffeine, found in coffee, tea, cocoa, and various energy drinks, is a widely consumed psychoactive compound with noted analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Despite its long history of use, caffeine\u2019s impact on cardiovascular health remains controversial, with both beneficial and harmful effects reported. This review examines the current literature on the effects of caffeine on cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), with an emphasis on preclinical and clinical studies, its pharmacokinetic properties, and the molecular mechanisms it modulates. There is evidence that moderate caffeine intake can be beneficial for some CVDs, such as hypertension, while for other CVDs, such as dyslipidemia, the evidence collected so far suggests that caffeine intake could be detrimental since it increases total cholesterol levels. But variability in dosage, intake patterns, and individual factors (such as genetics and diet) complicates the reliability of results. Additionally, challenges related to dose standardization and the absence of consistent clinical trial designs hinder the full utilization of caffeine in CVD treatment. Nonetheless, caffeine appears to be safe for individuals without significant cardiovascular conditions. Future research should aim for well-designed studies with precise patient cohorts and standardized methodologies to better assess caffeine\u2019s role in CVD management.",

Bone mineral density (BMD) of L1 vertebra and calcification of major/medium arteries were analyzed. Differences in clinical data, CT images and 10-year ICVD risk scores were compared between groups. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression identified independent risk factors for AC in UUTC patients. A scoring system to assess concurrent AC risk in UUTC patients was developed and validated.ResultsA total of 396 UUTC patients and 200 controls were included. AC prevalence was higher in UUTC group (71.7% vs 63.5%, P = 0.041), remained valid after controlling for specific confounding factors. UUTC patients exhibited lower BMD of L1 vertebra.

    "content": "Phosphorus (P) removal from water and recovery into usable forms is a critical component of creating a sustainable P cycle, although mature technologies for P removal and recovery are still lacking. The goal of this paper was to advance the testing of novel materials for P removal and recovery from water by providing guidance on the development of more realistic aqueous matrices used during materials development. Literature reports of \u201cnew\u201d materials to remove P from water are often difficult to compare in terms of performance because authors use a myriad of water chemistries containing P concentrations, pH, and competing ions. Moreover, many tests are conducted in simplified matrices that do not reflect conditions in real systems. To address this critical gap, the research herein developed a systematic approach of identifying aqueous matrices relevant to P recovery, including key components in the aqueous matrices having the greatest influence on the mechanisms of P removal with emphasis on phosphate precipitation and phosphate adsorption, and providing guidelines on relevant \u201crecipes\u201d for aqueous solutions for testing novel materials. Key components in the aqueous matrices included hydrogen ion (i.e., pH), multivalent metal cations, and dissolved organic matter due to their influence on phosphate precipitation and adsorption mechanisms. Recipes for buffer solution and synthetic groundwater, surface water, anaerobic digestate, and stored urine are discussed in the context of P removal and recovery processes. Wherein the adoption of standard matrices in other fields have permitted direct comparison of processes or materials, it is anticipated that adoption of relevant aqueous matrix recipes for P removal and recovery will improve the ability to directly compare novel materials and processes.",

    "content": "Pasta is widely consumed, and incorporating certain components can transform it into a functional food with health advantages. These components include antioxidants, dietary fiber, and enzyme inhibitors associated with a decreased risk of various health issues. The Malus domestica variety Annurca is abundant in bioactive compounds, making it a suitable candidate for producing functional foods. We developed durum wheat tagliatelle enriched with dried and powdered Annurca pulp or peels at two distinct supplementation levels (3% and 6%) on a laboratory scale. The in vitro ability to inhibit digestive enzymes and the predicted glycaemic value of the enriched pasta were evaluated. Every formulation demonstrated inhibition of \u03b1-amylase, \u03b1-glucosidase, cholesterol esterase, and lipase in vitro. All the samples exhibited a low predicted glycaemic index (pGI), ranging from 41.25 to 45.76. These low pGI values indicate that fortified pasta has a lower impact on blood sugar levels and a slower digestion rate. The predicted glycaemic indices for pasta enriched with 3% or 6% pulp flour were 18.7% and 26.7% lower, respectively, than those for control pasta with durum wheat semolina alone. The reductions were similar for peel-enriched pasta at 3% and 6% (24.4% and 24.7%, respectively). Our in vitro results indicate that Annurca apple-fortified pasta has lipid- and glucose-lowering effects. Adding Annurca fruit flour with valuable and functional compounds could be relevant for obtaining pasta with potential health benefits.",

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) provides comprehensive structural and functional assessment for detecting age-related cardiovascular remodelling. We aimed to develop a fully automated CMR model to predict functional heart age.Methods and resultsThis international, multi-centre, retrospective observational study enrolled 191 healthy individuals with normal body mass index (BMI), free of metabolic, cardiovascular, and respiratory disease as the derivation cohort. Left atrial (LA) end-systolic volume and LA ejection fraction were selected for the final model. The model was validated on 366 patients with BMI >25\u2005kg/m2 and one or more comorbidities [hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), atrial fibrillation (AF), and obesity]. In healthy individuals [median age: 34 years, 105 (55%) female], CMR-derived functional heart age was similar to the chronological age [bias: 0.05%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 9.56\u20139.67%, P = 0.993]. In the validation cohort [median age: 53 years, 157 (43%) female], CMR-derived functional heart age was 4.6 years higher than chronological age (95% CI: 1.6\u20137.6 years, P = 0.003). Cardiac magnetic resonance-derived functional heart age was significantly higher in patients with hypertension (P < 0.001), DM (P < 0.001), and AF (P < 0.001) than age-matched healthy controls. Moreover, CMR-derived functional heart age was higher than the chronological age in obesity Class I (P = 0.07), obesity Class II (P = 0.11), and obesity Class III (P < 0.001).ConclusionThis study highlights the time course of structural and physiological changes in the heart during healthy and unhealthy ageing. We propose simple equations that should help communicate subtle changes in heart assessment with ageing.Registration\nClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05114785",

We propose that the major mitochondrial alarmin in myeloid cells is oxidized mitochondrial DNA (Ox-mtDNA). Fragmented Ox-mtDNA enters the cytosol where it activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and generates IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, and cGAS\u2013STING to induce type I interferons and interferon-stimulated genes. Inflammasome activation further enables the circulatory release of Ox-mtDNA by opening gasdermin D pores. We summarize new data showing that, in addition to being an autoimmune disease biomarker, Ox-mtDNA converts beneficial transient inflammation into long-lasting immunopathology.

Using multiple, independent molecular, rodent, and in vitro experimental models, we found that microbiome composition influenced multiple oxalate-microbe-host interfaces. Importantly, the administration of the oxalate-degrading specialist, Oxalobacter formigenes, was only effective against a poor oxalate-degrading microbiota background and gives critical new insights into why clinical intervention trials with this species exhibit variable outcomes. Data suggest that, while heterogeneity in the microbiome impacts multiple diet-host-microbe interfaces, metabolic redundancy among diverse microorganisms in specific diet-microbe axes is a critical variable that may impact the efficacy of bacteriotherapies, which can help guide patient and probiotic selection criteria in probiotic clinical trials.",

Lymphatic vessels are important in modulating inflammation postinjury. Manipulating lymphatic vessel expansion thus has the potential to alter CKD progression. Previously, we demonstrated that renal lymphatic expansion before injury reduced CKD progression after an AKI. Here, we test whether inducing lymphangiogenesis affects established CKD.MethodsAfter CKD progression, kidney lymphatics were expanded by transgenic induction of kidney-specific overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor-D in aristolochic acid (AA) nephropathy and cisplatin injury aggravated with chronic high phosphate diet (CisPi) models or by infusion of kidney-targeting nanoparticles loaded with the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 specific ligand vascular endothelial growth factor-C C156S in a progressive proteinuria (POD) model. Renal fibrosis and lymphatic density were determined by picrosirius red staining and immunofluorescence, respectively. Renal function was assessed by creatinine clearance rate, serum creatinine, BUN, and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio. Renal proinflammatory and fibrotic markers expression were measured by quantitative RT-PCR.ResultsKidney-specific overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor-D+ mice demonstrated expanded renal lymphatics, while nanoparticles treatment minimally expanded lymphatics. In neither the AA nor POD model did lymphangiogenesis improve renal function or fibrosis. AA mice showed decreased Tgfb1 expression and POD mice showed increased Col4a1 expression. Expansion worsened function in CisPi CKD and increased fibrosis. CisPi kidneys also demonstrated increased expression of Mcp-1, Il1b, Col1a1, and Tgfb1 and increased macrophage numbers.ConclusionsTherapeutically induced lymphatic expansion is ineffective in resolving established CKD and has the potential to further worsen CKD progression.",

    "content": "ABSTRACTThe African turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri) is becoming a favorable model for neurobiological research. The combination of a short lifespan and a declining neuroregenerative capacity upon aging makes it ideally suited for research on brain aging and regeneration. A remarkable cellular diversity makes up the young-adult killifish telencephalon, characterized by highly proliferative non-glial progenitors and spatially distinct radial glia subtypes. In contrast to a relatively slow embryonic development, hatching is followed by a period of accelerated growth, in which the brain experiences a period of rapid expansion and maturation. In this study, we quantified the growth progression and maturation of the killifish telencephalon during early post-embryonic development. We discovered that, similar to in zebrafish, neuro-epithelial cells abut the neurogenic niches from early life onwards. Spatial data revealed qualitative and quantitative differences along the anterior-posterior axis and between pallial and subpallial regions in terms of growth pace. We confirmed generation of GABAergic neurons from the subpallial neurogenic niche and glutamatergic neurons from two pallial niches. Our data further showed a more widespread appearance of inhibitory neurons at hatching compared to in zebrafish.",

Menopause accelerates dementia risk by increasing the risk for metabolic, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular diseases. Mid-life metabolic disease (obesity, diabetes/prediabetes) is a well-known risk factor for dementia. A high fat diet can lead to poor metabolic health in both humans and rodents.\n\n\nObjective:\nOur goal was to determine the effects of high fat diet on metabolic outcomes in the AppNL-F knock-in mouse model of AD and assess the effects of menopause.\n\n\nMethods:\nFirst, 3-month-old AppNL-F and WT female mice were placed on either a control or a high fat diet until 10 months of age then assessed for metabolic outcomes. Next, we did a more extensive assessment in AppNL-F mice that were administered VCD (4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide) or vehicle (oil) and placed on a control or high fat diet for 7 months. VCD was used to model menopause by causing accelerated ovarian failure.\n\n\nResults:\nCompared to WT controls, AD female mice had worse glucose intolerance. Menopause led to metabolic impairment (weight gain and glucose intolerance) and further exacerbated obesity in response to a high fat diet. There were interactions between diet and menopause on some metabolic health serum biomarkers and the expression of hypothalamic markers related to energy balance.\n\n\nConclusions:\nThis work highlights the need to model endocrine aging in animal models of dementia and will contribute to further understanding the interaction between menopause and metabolic health in the context of AD.",

    "content": "BackgroundObesity and its related comorbidities are a major health concern, with numbers increasing globally. There is a need for innovative approaches to prevent obesity or mitigate the negative health effects. Research suggests that ginger consumption has an anti-obesity effect through various mechanisms, including changes in lipid metabolism and increases in thermogenesis. This study assessed the effects of a ginger-containing supplement on energy expenditure and substrate utilization.MethodsTen males\u00a0volunteered for this double-blind, two-dose crossover, proof-of-concept study. Resting energy expenditure (REE) and respiratory exchange ratio\u00a0(RER) were assessed prior to supplementation and throughout both study visits. After consuming a ginger-containing supplement (Gyngerlean\u2122 100 or 200 mg doses), REE was assessed at 60, 120, and 180 minutes at each visit. There was a minimum 24-hour washout period between the two study visits.ResultsNo significant differences were observed at baseline between the 100 mg and 200 mg doses for REE\u00a0(100 mg: 2203 \u00b1 497 kcal vs. 200 mg: 2454 \u00b1 501 kcal; p = 0.2408) or the RER\u00a0(100 mg: 0.79 \u00b1 0.09 vs. 200 mg: 0.81 \u00b1 0.04; p = 0.4911). Post-dosing, the 100 mg dose showed no significant changes in REE or RER over all time points. For the 200 mg dose, REE remained stable over all time points (no significant change), while the RER showed a significant reduction at 120\u00a0and 180 minutes post-consumption (p < 0.05).\u00a0ConclusionThis exploratory study demonstrated increased fat oxidation following acute ingestion of a ginger-containing supplement (200 mg), suggesting the potential role of ginger in weight and body composition management. Future studies are needed to further the understanding and potential application of this finding. More research is warranted.",

Although endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is known to be related to both clinical and endoscopic activity in UC, its role in defining HH remains unclear. Therefore, this study was aimed at investigating the association between EUS and histological activity (HA), as well as the predictive potential of EUS for HH.MethodIn this cross-sectional analysis, 68 UC adults underwent EUS and colonoscopy with biopsies. We used the Mayo Endoscopic Score (MES) for endoscopic activity, the Nancy Index (NI) for biopsy grading, and the Endoscopic Ultrasound-Ulcerative Colitis (EUS-UC) score for EUS analysis, defining endoscopic remission as MES \u2264 1 and HH as NI \u2264 1.A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was employed to evaluate the ability of the indices to predict HH.ResultsTotally 23 patients (33.80%) achieved HH, while 45 (66.20%) showed HA. The EUS-UC scores were significantly lower in the HH group (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and correlated strongly with NI (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.73). EUS-UC score was an independent risk factor for HH (adjusted OR = 1.918, 95% CI: 1.195\u20133.080, p\u2009=\u20090.007). The EUS-UC score demonstrated a strong predictive value for HH, with an AUC of 0.840, a sensitivity of 75.56%, and a specificity of 78.26%.ConclusionThe EUS-UC score has a significant correlation with histological outcomes and shows strong potential as a reliable, invasive predictor of HH in UC, with implications for improved disease monitoring.",

    "content": "The human microbiota comprises a diverse microbial ecosystem that significantly impacts health and disease. Among its components, the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating metabolic, immunologic, and inflammatory responses. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in microbial composition, has been linked to carcinogenesis through mechanisms such as chronic inflammation, metabolic disturbances, epigenetic modifications, and immune system dysregulation. Additionally, dysbiosis influences the efficacy and toxicity of cancer therapies. Given these associations, there is growing interest in leveraging the microbiota as a biomarker for cancer detection and outcome prediction. Notably, distinct microbial signatures have been identified across various cancer types, suggesting their potential as diagnostic markers. Furthermore, modulation of the microbiota presents a promising avenue for improving cancer treatment outcomes through strategies such as antibiotics, prebiotics, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, dietary interventions, small-molecule inhibitors, and phage therapy. To explore these relationships, we conducted a comprehensive literature review using Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar as our primary online databases, focusing on indexed peer-reviewed articles up to the present year. This review aims to elucidate the role of dysbiosis in cancer development, examine the molecular mechanisms involved, and assess the impact of microbiota on cancer therapies. Additionally, we highlight microbiota-based therapeutic strategies and discuss their potential applications in cancer management. A deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between the microbiota and cancer may pave the way for novel approaches to cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment optimization.Graphical abstract",

Reversed Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Pattern (rEDIP), Empirical Dietary Index for Hyperinsulinemia (rEDIH), and Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2020 scores were computed from food frequency questionnaire data. Stool samples were profiled using 16S rRNA sequencing. Elastic net regression identified diet-associated microbial profiles and multivariable-adjusted linear regression assessed diet-biomarker associations. Higher rEDIP, rEDIH, and HEI-2020 scores were positively associated with gut microbiota alpha diversity. Specific genera, including Intestinibacter and Lachnospira, associated positively, while Dielma, Peptococcus, Feacalitalea, and Negativibaccilus associated inversely with healthier dietary patterns. When evaluating changes in dietary patterns between baseline and visit 4 (\u2009~\u200914\u2009years), these genera tended to define rEDIP, rEDIH more than HEI-2020. In addition, higher dietary quality was linked to better biomarker profiles, including lower creatinine, sodium, triglycerides, and insulin resistance. Beneficial effects of higher dietary quality on health may be mediated by the ability of diet to regulate gut microbial composition and metabolic biomarker profiles.",

    "content": "Background and Objectives: Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is frequently prescribed during pregnancy to treat mood disorders. Studies indicate that chronic use of sertraline is associated with elevated liver enzymes, oxidative stress, and histological alterations in the liver. Folic acid, a recommended supplement currently used during the first trimester of pregnancy, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Hence, folic acid might be a potential protective agent against sertraline-induced liver injury. The current study aimed to investigate the possible hepatotoxic effects of sertraline administration during pregnancy and early postpartum. In addition, we sought to evaluate the potential protective effects of folic acid supplementation in alleviating any sertraline-induced liver damage. Materials and Methods: Eighty pregnant albino rats were randomly divided into four groups: control, folic acid-treated, sertraline-treated, and folic acid\u2013sertraline-treated. Each group was divided into rats euthanized immediately after giving birth (0 h) or 14 days postpartum. Biochemical, histological, and immunohistochemical evaluations of liver function and structure were conducted. Results: Administration of sertraline was associated with a significant increase in hepatic enzymes (ALT and AST) and disrupted lipid profile (elevated cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-c) compared to the control group. Increased apoptosis was evidenced by increased caspase 3 expression and histological alterations, including vacuolation and inflammatory infiltrates, in sertraline-treated rats. Folic acid supplementation effectively mitigated these effects by preserving liver architecture, normalizing biochemical markers (ALT, AST, and lipid profile changes), and reducing apoptotic activity (lower caspase 3 expression). Conclusions: Folic acid mitigated sertraline-induced hepatic damage in pregnant rats. This suggests the potential benefits of using folic acid during the whole duration of pregnancy in patients treated with sertraline.",

While lifestyle factors, carcinogenic exposure, and healthcare access contribute to these disparities, they do not fully explain the observed male-female variation in anti-tumor immunity. Despite the preferential expression of sex hormone receptors in immune cells, X chromosome also contains numerous genes involved in immune function, and its incomplete inactivation may enhance anti-tumor immune responses in females. In contrast, loss or downregulation of Y-linked genes in males has been associated with an increased cancer risk. Additionally, estrogen, progesterone and androgen signaling pathways influence both innate and adaptive immune responses, contributing to sex-specific outcomes in cancer progression and therapy. Sex-biased differences are also evident in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, cellular senescence, microbiota composition, metabolism, and DNA damage response, all of which impact anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapy treatment efficacy. In general, the combination of sex chromosomes, sex hormones, and hormone receptors orchestrates the phenotype and function of various immune cells involved in tumor immunity. However, sex disparity in each specific immune cell are context and environment dependent, considering the preferential expression of hormone receptor in immune cell and sex hormone levels fluctuate significantly across different life stages.

Pomegranate flower, a kind of traditional Chinese medicine, has shown promising anti\u2010inflammatory, antioxidant, and antidiabetic properties, but its potential skin\u2010lightening effects have not been well explored.AimsWe investigated the effect of pomegranate flower water extract (PFE) on skin lightening and elucidated its underlying mechanisms.MethodsThe radical scavenging capacity was measured by ABTS and DPPH assays, and the mechanism of lightening was detected by Western blot.ResultsPFE could obviously inhibit tyrosinase activity, which its inhibition IC50 value was lower than the positive control, kojic acid. Meanwhile, the radical scavenging capacity was also better than vitamin C (VC). Then the synthesis ability of melanin was measured in B16F10 cells; we found that PFE, in its safe concentrations, could reduce the synthesis of melanin resulting from inhibiting TYR activities. The expression of the main melanogenesis enzymes TYR, TRP\u20101, and TRP\u20102 was sharply reduced. Interestingly, MITF, a transcription factor of TYR, was obviously decreased its expression when treated with PFE at 50, 100, and 150\u2009\u03bcg/mL, which was even significantly lower than the downregulation by kojic acid.ConclusionPomegranate flower extract possessed a strong antimelanogenesis effect, which resulted from inhibiting the expression of MITF and its downstream target enzymes involved in melanin synthesis. These findings provide a strong scientific basis for the use of PFE as a safe and effective skin\u2010lightening ingredient in the cosmetic industry.",

    "content": "IntroductionHead and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) frequently invades the jaw, and surgical treatment often leads to bone defects requiring reconstruction with titanium plates. To enhance the anti-tumor and bone regeneration properties of titanium, a selenium-modified hydroxyapatite coating was developed on titanium surfaces.MethodsSelenium-modified hydroxyapatite coatings was fabricated using micro-arc oxidation (MAO). The coating properties were characterized by SEM, XPS, AFM, Contacting angle test and ICP-OES. Cell proliferation assays were performed using rBMSCs and Cal27 cells. The osteogenic potential of the materials was assessed via ALP and OCN immunofluorescence staining and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Apoptosis in Cal27 cells was analyzed through flow cytometry, and ROS levels in rBMSCs and Cal27 cells were measured using ROS fluorescent probes.ResultsA coating was successfully formed on the surface of titanium with a porous structure via MAO. The atomic percentages of calcium, phosphorus and selenium on the coating surface were 42.47%, 45.43% and 12.3%, respectively, and the ion components could be released steadily and slowly. In vitro, 0.2\u00a0\u00b5g/mL selenium had toxic effects on Cal27 and promoted osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs. PCR showed that selenium increased the expression of genes related to osteogenic differentiation of rBMSCs by 3\u20135 times. ROS detection found differences in intracellular ROS content between Cal27 and rBMSCs.DiscussionBy incorporating selenium-modified coatings, titanium implant materials can simultaneously promote osteogenesis and inhibit tumor growth, offering a promising strategy for postoperative functional recovery in HNSCC patients.",

    "content": "Background: Allergic rhinitis is an IgE-mediated condition of nasal congestion, runny nose, and sneezing which significantly impairs the quality of life. Current treatments, including antihistamines, often have long-term side effects, leading patients to seek safer alternatives. Objectives: Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the symptom relief efficacy of immature sword bean pod (SBP) extract, a natural material, in patients with allergic rhinitis, explore the mechanisms by which SBP regulates allergic immune responses, and evaluate its efficacy and safety as a functional ingredient in the management of allergic rhinitis. Methods: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial involving 64 participants with perennial allergic rhinitis, the subjects were assigned to receive either SBP or placebo orally for six weeks. Results: The SBP group exhibited significant improvements in nasal congestion (interaction p = 0.031), RQLQ (interaction p = 0.001), sleep (interaction p = 0.004), systemic reaction (interaction p = 0.002), daily life (interaction p = 0.047), and nasal symptoms (interaction p = 0.002). SBP treatment in EoL-1 and HMC-1 cells also led to a notable reduction in eosinophil cationic protein levels (p < 0.05), a key biomarker of allergic inflammation, by inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation, resulting in decreased eosinophil activity. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the SBP extract is a promising natural treatment for allergic rhinitis, offering both efficacy and safety by improving key symptoms and reducing inflammatory responses.",

We explored the knowledge, practices, and perceptions of healthcare providers on cervical cancer screening (CCS) among HIV-positive women aged 18\u201349 years in Lira City.\nMethods: In June 2023, a qualitative cross-sectional study was conducted among healthcare providers at Lira Regional Referral Hospital (LRRH), Lira City, Northern Uganda. Key informant interviews (KIIs) were used to collect data among purposively selected healthcare providers. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using the NVivo (QSR International) software. Thematic content analysis was used in data analysis.\nResults: The study found that participants had good knowledge about cervical cancer and screening. They provided health education and vaccination for eligible girls and screened HIV-positive women for cervical cancer. Long waiting hours, long distances to healthcare facilities, and negative attitudes of some health providers were reported as barriers to CCS utilization. However, increased awareness, the presence of signs/symptoms, and the desire to maintain optimal health facilitated CCS utilization among HIV-positive women.\nConclusion: Whereas the participants' knowledge and perceptions about CCS were good, their practices towards CCS among HIV-positive women were suboptimal. Continuous education of healthcare providers, decentralization of CCS, and routine and ongoing health education initiatives are pivotal in improving CCS practices among HIV-positive women.",

Disaggregating data along a health pathway, i.e., the measurable continuum from risk factor exposure to final health outcome (death), and including disease prevalence and a three-step care cascade (diagnosis, treatment, and control), has the potential to provide a holistic and systematic source of information on sex- and gender-based health inequities and identify opportunities for more tailored interventions to reduce those inequities.Methods and findingsWe collected sex- and age-disaggregated data along the health pathway. We searched for papers using global datasets on the sex-disaggregated care cascade for eight major conditions and identified cascade data for only three conditions: hypertension, diabetes, and HIV and AIDS. For each condition, we collected risk factor prevalence, disease prevalence, cascade progression, and death rates. We assessed the sex difference for all steps along the pathway and interpreted inequities through a lens of gender analysis. Sex-disaggregated data on risk factors, disease prevalence, and mortality were found for all three conditions across 204 countries. Sex-disaggregated care cascades for hypertension, diabetes, and HIV and AIDS were found only for 200, 39, and 76 countries, respectively. Significant sex differences were found in each step along the pathways. In many countries, males exhibited higher disease prevalence and death rates than females, while in some countries, they also reported lower rates of healthcare seeking, diagnosis, and treatment adherence. Smoking prevalence was higher among males in most countries, whereas prevalence of obesity and unsafe sex were higher in females in most countries.ConclusionsFindings support the increasing need to develop strategies that encourage greater male participation in preventive and healthcare service and underscore the importance of sex-disaggregated data in understanding health inequities and guiding gender-responsive interventions at different points along the pathway. Despite limitations in data availability and completeness, this study elucidates the need for more comprehensive and harmonized datasets for these and other conditions to monitor sex differences and implement sex-/gender-responsive interventions along the health pathway.",

While the immune response that triggers inflammatory signaling cascades is unresolved, its progression could cause functional damage to neurons and glial cells, including astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. Controlling neuroinflammatory signaling at the early stage of disease pathogenesis is critical to prevent irreversible tissue necrosis. While the application of anti-inflammatory drugs is standard practice, their protracted use is known to cause gastrointestinal injuries, further enhancing the risk of cardiovascular, renal, liver, and lung diseases. Several medicinal herbs and herbal products with anti-inflammatory potential could be effective substitutes.

While the cutaneous form causes disfigurement, the visceral form could be fatal if not treated. With no available vaccines combined with serious side effects of current medications and emerging drug resistance, it is crucial to discover new drugs whether as novel compounds or as repurposed existing pharmaceuticals. In the realm of drug development, mitochondria are recognized as important pharmacological targets due to their critical role in energy control, which, when disrupted, leads to irreversible cell damage. Certain plant-based compounds able to target the parasite mitochondrion, have been studied for their potential anti-leishmanial effects.Search resultsThese compounds have shown promising effects in eliminating the Leishmania parasite. Artemisinin and chloroquine, two anti-malarial drugs that target mitochondria, exert strong anti-leishmanial effectiveness in both in vitro cultures and in vivo animal models.

Flavoring agents such as diacetyl contribute to occupational respiratory diseases like bronchiolitis obliterans. In animal models, prenatal exposure to additives, such as titanium dioxide (E171), might disrupt the development of respiratory neural networks, with long-term consequences. Ultra-processed foods (UPFs), which also contain a high concentration of additives, lead to systemic inflammation and impair lung function. Despite their wide usage, the use of these additives has become a warning sign due to their safety issue, particularly in sensitive people like children, pregnant women, and patients with pre-existing respiratory and chronic conditions. The review highlights the serious need for strict regulation and further research on the long-term effects of food additives on respiratory health. Policymakers should ban these food additives that are more harmful to human health. As an alternative to artificial additives, natural flavors and colors from fruits and vegetables, safe preservatives, and minimally processed ingredients can be used.",

Conventional treatment modalities usually exhibit serious adverse complications, which also negatively affect patients\u2019 quality of life. In the context of exploring new treatment approaches with fewer side effects, the utilization of natural compounds as alternative and/or complementary therapeutic options seems appealing. In the present study, the potential use and effects of various bioactive phytochemicals, including curcumin, resveratrol, epigallocatechin, genistein, and several others, in bladder cancer treatment are thoroughly reviewed. A special focus is given to their potential to beneficially modulate important molecular signaling pathways and mechanisms affecting cell survival, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, which play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of bladder cancer, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK, Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin, Notch, Hedgehog, Hippo, JAK2/STAT3, and PAF/PAF-receptor pathways. Nevertheless, most studies have been conducted in cell cultures and animal models. Due to differences in genetics and metabolism, more clinical trials are needed to ensure the bio-efficacy of these phytochemicals in humans.",

    "content": "Cholesterol and its metabolic derivatives have important biological functions and are crucial in tumor initiation, progression, and treatment. Cholesterol maintains the physical properties of cellular membranes and is pivotal in cell signal transduction. Cholesterol metabolism includes both de novo synthesis and uptake from extracellular sources such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). This review explores both aspects to provide a comprehensive understanding of their roles in cancer. Cholesterol metabolism is involved in bile acid production and steroid hormone biosynthesis and is closely linked to the reprogramming of endogenous and exogenous cellular signals within the tumor microenvironment. These signals are intricately associated with key biological processes such as tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis. Evidence suggests that regulating cholesterol metabolism may offer therapeutic benefits by inhibiting tumor growth, remodeling the immune microenvironment, and enhancing antitumor immune responses. This review summarizes the role of cholesterol metabolism in tumor biology and discusses the application of statins and other cholesterol metabolism inhibitors in cancer therapy, aiming to provide novel insights for the development of antitumor drugs targeting cholesterol metabolism and for advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment.",

However, there have been few studies on ILL's antitumor role and no reports on its role in bladder cancer (BC).Materials and methodsHuman BC cell lines T24 and EJ-1 were treated with different concentrations of ILL (0, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 \u03bcmol/L), and the cell proliferation inhibition rate was analyzed using the CCK-8 assay. The effect of ILL on T24 and EJ-1 cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis was examined using flow cytometry. Immunoblotting was used to detect the levels of apoptosis-related proteins, BAX, BAK1, and CYCS, in BC cells of the control and ILL-treated groups, and quantitative PCR experiments were performed to detect the apoptosis-related gene expression of CASP10, CYCS, BAX, BCL-2, CASP8, and BAK1. T24 and EJ-1 tumor-bearing mouse models were established and divided into vehicle control, low-dose (10 mg/kg) and high-dose (20 mg/kg) groups, with 5 mice in each group. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry were used to detect changes in apoptosis-related proteins in vivo.ResultsThe CCK-8 assay showed that in vitro, ILL significantly inhibited the proliferation of the T24 and EJ-1 BC cell lines. Flow cytometry and immunoblotting results showed that ILL increased mitochondrial permeability by upregulating proapoptotic proteins BAK1 and BAX, promoting CYCS release and significantly inducing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. In vivo, on day 25 of administration, tumor inhibition rates in T24 and EJ-1 tumor-bearing mice were up to 75.24% and 47.43%, respectively, in the ILL high-dose\u2013treated and 71.58% and 43.89%, respectively, in the ILL low-dose\u2013treated groups.ConclusionsIsolinderalactone controls BC progression by inducing apoptosis, suggesting that ILL may be an effective drug for the treatment of BC.",

Using optical coherence tomography (OCT), we observe that the urothelium absorbs and expels water under varying concentrations of NaCl, challenging long-held views about its impermeability. The discovery that osmotic stress can induce urothelial damage has implications for bladder disorders such as interstitial cystitis and overactive bladder, where urothelial integrity is compromised.AimTraditionally considered impermeable, the urothelium has recently been implicated in water transport due to the presence of aquaporins. Despite this, direct evidence of the urothelial response to water movement through the urothelium remains elusive. We aim to provide such evidence by examining urothelial responses to NaCl solutions using OCT.ApproachFresh porcine bladder samples were subjected to OCT imaging to observe urothelial responses under varying osmolarity conditions, using NaCl solutions ranging from 0.31 to 2.07\u2009\u2009Osm/L. Urothelial optical pathlength thickness was measured pre-NaCl and post-NaCl application. In addition, histological and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were conducted to assess cellular integrity and damage.ResultsOCT imaging revealed a significant increase in urothelial optical pathlength thickness following deionized water application, indicative of water absorption. Conversely, exposure to higher osmolarity NaCl solutions resulted in urothelial shrinkage, suggesting water efflux. Histological analysis demonstrated intact cellular structures at lower osmolarities (0.31\u2009\u2009Osm/L) but significant cellular disruption at higher concentrations (\u22651.03\u2009\u2009Osm/L). SEM analysis corroborated these findings, showing progressive damage to umbrella cells with increasing osmolarity.ConclusionsWe provide evidence that the urothelium is a dynamic barrier capable of water transport, influenced by osmotic gradients. The observed osmotic-induced urothelial damage may have important implications for the pathophysiology of conditions such as interstitial cystitis and overactive bladder, offering insights into potential diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. These findings warrant further investigation using human tissue.",

    "content": "ABSTRACTMCM8 and MCM9 participate in homologous recombination with long\u2010tract gene conversion to repair double\u2010strand breaks caused by replication stress, which is generally higher in cancer cells than in normal cells. MCM8 is highly expressed in certain cancer cells, where it is necessary for maintaining cell growth, migration, and invasion, although the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Knockdown with siRNAs or knockout of MCM8 or MCM9 selectively sensitizes cancer cells to cisplatin. Thus, drugs inhibiting MCM8 or MCM9 could serve as novel anti\u2010neoplastic agents and/or chemosensitizers that selectively sensitize cancer cells to platinum compounds. The present study describes the development of an amido\u2010bridged nucleic acid (AmNA)\u2010modified gapmer antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting MCM8, called ASO 8\u20133419. In\u00a0vitro, ASO 8\u20133419 inhibited MCM8 expression in several human cell lines and selectively sensitized cancer cells to cisplatin. Moreover, ASO 8\u20133419 modestly suppressed the growth of several cancer cell lines whose proliferation has been reported to depend on MCM8. In\u00a0vivo, ASO 8\u20133419 inhibited the expression of MCM8 in xenografted tumors of colon cancer\u2010derived HCT116 cells in nude mice and increased tumor sensitivity to cisplatin with minimal toxicity.

However, evidence directly linking increased serum uric acid levels to endometriosis in women remains sparse, and the precise characteristics of this influence are still not fully understood.ObjectiveTo explore the exact relationship between serum uric acid and endometriosis.Study designReferencing the data accumulated from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), this study covers the period from 1999 to 2006, conducted an analysis of 5,162 female participants aged 20 to 54 years (representing a sample size of approximately 66,927,890 women). The study adopted a cross-sectional methodology to delve into the tie between serum uric acid and the prevalence of endometriosis. Utilizing rigorous methodologies, including weighted multivariable logistic regression models, subgroup analyses, and statistical methodologies for smooth curve fitting.ResultsA positive association was found between continuous serum uric acid and the risk of endometriosis (OR = 1.25, 95% CI [1.09, 1.44], P = 0.003). At the same time, women in the highest quartile had a 133% higher risk of endometriosis compared with women with the lowest quartile of uric acid (OR=2.33,95%CI [1.28, 4.23], P=0.009).

In this study, we explored the effects of Galloflavin and Ellagic acid, the most common polyphenols in berries, on SIRT6.\nSIRT6 deacetylation was investigated using HPLC and immunoblotting assays. The expression levels of SIRT6, glycolytic proteins and cellular metabolism were studied on human colon adenocarcinoma cells (Caco2). Molecular docking studies were carried out to study possible interactions of the compounds with sirtuins.\nEllagic acid increased the deacetylase activity of SIRT6 by up to 50-fold; it showed moderate inhibition of SIRT1\u20133. Galloflavin and Ellagic acid showed anti-proliferative effects on Caco2. The compounds also upregulated SIRT6 expression whereas key proteins in glycolysis were downregulated. Galloflavin decreased glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression, and Ellagic acid affected the expression of protein dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1). Interestingly, both compounds caused reduction in glucose uptake and lactate production. Both Galloflavin and Ellagic acid were able to form hydrogen bonds with Asp188 and Gly6 in SIRT6.\nIn this study, we showed that Galloflavin and Ellagic acid increased SIRT6 activity and decreased the expression of SIRT6 associated proteins involved in cancer development.

This study aimed to identify the individual, feeding, household, and community determinants of anemia among children in Mozambique. Methods: We used pooled datasets of two Mozambique representative population-based surveys: the 2011 and 2022\u20132023 Demographic and Health Surveys. A total sample of 8143 children aged 6\u201359 months with available hemoglobin testing was included. Multilevel mixed-effects analysis was performed using STATA (18.0). Results: Over a decade, the prevalence of anemia in children aged 6\u201359 months remained high, increasing slightly from 69.1% in 2011 to 72.9% in 2022. Children aged 6\u201311 months were less likely to have anemia than children from other age groups (aOR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.62\u20130.96). Children who suffered from illnesses (aOR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.18\u20131.75), received vitamin A supplements (aOR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.63\u20130.93), lived in female-headed households (aOR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.01\u20131.32), and who lived in households with unimproved drinking water sources (aOR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.19\u20131.65) were more likely to have anemia than their peers.

This study aimed to 1) compare health profiles of patients screened for inactivity versus patients not screened for inactivity, and 2) compare health profiles of inactive, insufficiently active, and active patients as measured by the Exercise Vital Sign screener.MethodsThe study sample comprised adult patients attending a well visit from November 1, 2017, through December 1, 2022, at a large midwestern university hospital. We extracted data from electronic medical records on exercise behavior reported by patients using the Exercise Vital Sign (EVS) questionnaire. We extracted data on demographics characteristics, resting pulse, encounters, and disease diagnoses from PCORnet Common Data Model (version 6.1). We used the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index to determine disease burden. We compared patients with complete and valid EVS values (n =7,261) with patients not screened for inactivity (n = 33,445). We conducted further comparisons between screened patients reporting 0 minutes (inactive), 1 to 149 minutes (insufficiently active), or \u2265150 minutes (active) minutes per week of moderate-vigorous physical activity.ResultsPatients screened for inactivity had significantly lower rates of several comorbid conditions, including obesity (P < .001), diabetes (P < .001), and hypertension (P < .001) when compared with unscreened patients. Compared with insufficiently active and inactive patients, active patients had a lower risk of 19 inactivity-related comorbid conditions including obesity (P < .001), depression (P < .001), hypertension (P < .001), diabetes (P < .001), and valvular disease (P < .001).ConclusionThese findings suggest inactive and insufficiently active patients are at increased risk for multiple inactivity-related chronic conditions.

This narrative review synthesizes the latest findings on the influence of gut microbiota on PsA, focusing on mechanisms such as immune modulation, microbial dysbiosis, the gut-joint axis, and its impact on treatment. Advances in high-throughput sequencing and metagenomics have revealed distinct microbial profiles associated with PsA. Studies show that individuals with PsA have a unique gut microbiota composition, differing significantly from healthy controls. Alterations in the abundance of specific bacterial taxa, including a decrease in beneficial bacteria and an increase in potentially pathogenic microbes, contribute to systemic inflammation by affecting the intestinal barrier and promoting immune responses. This review explores the impact of various factors on gut microbiota composition, including age, hygiene, comorbidities, and medication use. Additionally, it highlights the role of diet, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation as promising strategies to modulate gut microbiota and alleviate PsA symptoms.

Multivariable marginal Cox regression analysis was performed using the presumed risk factors for each group.ResultsIn total, 1,335 patients and 3,348 PIVCs were evaluated. Among patients with\u2009\u2264\u200924\u2009h of catheter dwelling, phlebitis occurrence was associated with ICU admission for non-surgical management with ICU admission for elective surgery as the reference, standardized drug administration in the ICU, and dexmedetomidine administration in the ICU. Among those with\u2009>\u200924\u2009h but\u2009\u2264\u200972\u2009h of catheter dwelling, it was associated with male sex with female sex as the reference, tetrafluoroethylene as the catheter material with polyurethane as the reference, nicardipine administration, and noradrenaline administration. Among those with\u2009>\u200972\u2009h of catheter dwelling, it was associated with a catheter size\u2009\u2265\u200918 G and nicardipine administration.ConclusionThe risk factors for phlebitis varied with the duration of catheter dwelling. Individualized catheter management, considering the duration of catheter dwelling, may help avoid phlebitis in patients admitted to the ICU.",

    "content": "IntroductionDuring orthodontic tooth movement, sterile inflammatory processes and alveolar bone resorption occur in the periodontal ligament, involving myeloid cells such as macrophages and osteoclasts. The myeloid p38\u03b1/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) not only regulates the inflammatory response of macrophages and osteoclast differentiation but also the activation of the osmoprotective transcription factor NFAT5 (nuclear factor of activated T cells 5) under high-salt conditions. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the relative role of myeloid p38\u03b1/MAPK in orthodontic tooth movement as a function of extracellular salt content.Material and methodsMacrophages and osteoclasts were differentiated from the bone marrow of mice lacking p38\u03b1/MAPK expression in myeloid cells (p38\u03b1\n\u0394myel) and controls for RNA analysis and calcium phosphate resorption assay. Controls and p38\u03b1\n\u0394myel mice were fed a low or a high salt diet for a total of two weeks. One week after the start of the diet, an elastic band was inserted between the first and second molar to induce orthodontic tooth movement. Atomic absorption spectrometry was used to assess the sodium balance of the jaw bone tissue. RNA was isolated from the periodontium of the first molar, osteoclast numbers and extent of orthodontic tooth movement were assessed. Results\nNfat5 mRNA was increased in macrophages and osteoclasts in vitro and in the periodontium in vivo after high salt treatment in control mice but not in p38\u03b1\n\u0394myel mice. While there was no salt effect on interleukin-6 (Il6) gene expression, prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2 (Ptgs2) mRNA was upregulated in control but not in p38\u03b1\n\u0394myel mice in vitro and in vivo. p38\u03b1/MAPK deletion increased osteoclast numbers after low and high salt diet. Of note, deletion of p38\u03b1/MAPK elevated osteoclast activity under control salt conditions but reduced osteoclast activity under high salt conditions. High-salt diet resulted in increased sodium ion deposition in the jaw of both genotypes, while tooth movement was only increased in control mice. In p38\u03b1\n\u0394myel mice, high salt diet reduced the extent of orthodontic tooth movement, which could be explained by the reduced bone resorption of osteoclasts.ConclusionWe conclude that myeloid p38\u03b1/MAPK promotes macrophage Ptgs2 expression and osteoclast activity in response to extracellular salt levels, thereby supporting orthodontic tooth movement.",

This study aimed to investigate key molecules regulating endothelial cell permeability and explore their role in the progression of periodontitis. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed leukocyte transendothelial migration in periodontitis is associated with endothelial cells. Moreover, increased vascular permeability was observed in both human and mouse periodontitis tissues. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) protein expression was significantly upregulated in endothelial cells within periodontitis tissues, with levels increasing as the disease progressed. NAMPT gain-of-function decreased VE-cadherin expression and membrane potential, increased HUVEC permeability, and promoted leukocyte trans-endothelial migration. Mechanically, NAMPT elevated levels of triglycerides and free fatty acids, leading to lipid droplet accumulation in HUVEC. Fatty acid synthase (FASN), an enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of fatty acids, is also raised with NAMPT. NAMPT promoted NADPH pool which is utilized in FASN-mediated lipogenesis. FASN inhibitor orlistat reversed lipogenesis and endothelial permeability induced by NAMPT. Furthermore, orlistat administration reduced periodontal vascular permeability and further reversed bone resorption in periodontitis mice. This study demonstrated that increased NAMPT in periodontitis promotes endothelial permeability by modulating FASN-mediated lipogenesis, thereby contributing to bone loss in periodontitis.",

This study investigated the effects of inulin supplementation on systemic health and its underlying mechanisms by integrating the microbiota and metabolome analyses. One hundred twenty 16-day-old male Cherry Valley ducks with similar initial body weight (BW) were randomly assigned to 20 cages, with two treatments (6 ducks/cage and 10 cages/treatment): a basal diet (CON group) or a basal diet supplemented with 25\u00a0g inulin/kg (INU group). The 18-d feeding trials demonstrated that ducks fed the inulin-supplemented diet presented significantly improved growth performance, bone health, and meat quality compared with those in the control group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Additionally, inulin supplementation reshaped the intestinal microbiota, increasing diversity and the abundance of Alistipes, Ligilactobacillus, and Streptococcus (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Metabolome analysis revealed that inulin feeding significantly modulated 13 metabolites (P\u2009<\u20090.05), which were enriched primarily in health-related metabolic pathways such as taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and histidine metabolism. Correlation analysis revealed a positive relationship among the modulated microbes and metabolites and improved healthy parameters. Overall, inulin supplementation improved the bone and muscle health of ducks by specifically modulating key gut microbes, metabolites, and associated metabolic pathways. These findings suggest that inulin supplementation represents a feasible nutritional strategy for improving the meat quality and bone health of intensively raised ducks.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-99693-3.",

    "content": "Osteoarthritis, a progressive and degenerative joint disease, disrupts the integrity of the entire joint structure, underscoring the urgency of identifying more effective therapeutic strategies and innovative targets. Among these, exercise therapy is considered a key component in the early management of osteoarthritis, functioning by stimulating the secretion of myokines from the skeletal muscle system. Irisin, a myokine predominantly secreted by skeletal muscle during exercise and encoded by the FNDC5 gene, has garnered attention for its regulatory effects on bone health. Emerging evidence suggests that irisin may play a protective role in osteoarthritis by promoting tissue homeostasis, enhancing subchondral bone density and microstructure, and inhibiting chondrocyte apoptosis. By improving chondrocyte viability, preserving extracellular matrix integrity, and maintaining homeostasis in osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes, irisin emerges as a promising therapeutic target for osteoarthritis. This review delves into the role of irisin in osteoarthritis pathogenesis, highlighting its influence on cartilage and bone metabolism as well as its dynamic relationship with exercise. Additionally, this review suggests that further exploration on its specific molecular mechanisms, optimization of drug delivery systems, and strategic utilization of exercise-induced benefits will be pivotal in unlocking the full potential of irisin as a novel intervention for osteoarthritis.",

It is authorised for use in the European Union (EU) in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008. The assessment involved a comprehensive review of existing authorisations, evaluations and new scientific data. Acesulfame K (E 950) was found to be stable under various conditions; at pH lower than 3 with increasing temperatures, it is degraded to a certain amount. Based on the available data, no safety concerns arise for genotoxicity of acesulfame K (E 950) and its degradation products. For the potential impurities, based on in silico data, a concern for genotoxicity was identified for 5\u2010chloro\u2010acesulfame; a maximum limit of 0.1 mg/kg, or alternatively, a request for appropriate genotoxicity data was recommended. Based on the synthesis of systematically appraised evidence of human and animal studies, the Panel concluded that there are no new studies suitable for identification of a reference point (RP) on adverse effects. Consequently, the Panel established an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 15 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day based on the highest dose tested without adverse effects in a chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity study in rats; a study considered of moderate risk of bias and one of two key studies from the previous evaluations by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). This revised ADI replaces the ADI of 9 mg/kg bw per day established by the SCF. The Panel noted that the highest estimate of exposure to acesulfame K (E 950) was generally below the ADI in all population groups. The Panel recommended the European Commission to consider the revision of the EU specifications of acesulfame K (E 950).",

However, most of the literature data remain descriptive regarding the mode of action at the cellular level, especially in humans, and further investigations are required for optimized therapeutic strategies. Methods: We first demonstrated in an L-NAME mouse model that TOTUM-854 supports the prevention of hypertension in vitro and in vivo. Then, we designed an ex vivo clinical innovative approach considering the circulating metabolites produced by the digestive tract upon TOTUM-854 ingestion in humans. Human serum was collected in healthy volunteers before and after the acute intake of 3.71 g of TOTUM-854. The bioavailability of circulating metabolites was confirmed and characterized by UPLC-MS. Human serum containing TOTUM-854-derived metabolites was further processed for incubation with human endothelial cells (HUVECs), in the absence or presence of palmitate (200 \u00b5M). Results: HUVEC protection against lipotoxicity was characterized by (1) decreased ACE-1 activity (\u221232% p < 0.0001); (2) the inhibition of oxidative stress with decreased ROS (\u221212% observed by DCFDA and DHE fluorescent microscopy) and decreased Nox2 gene expression (\u22126.7 fold change vs. palmitate, p < 0.01); and (3) the inhibition of an inflammatory response, with a decrease in IL-1\u03b2 release (\u221237% compared to palmitate, p < 0.001) and decreased MCP-1 and VCAM-1 gene expression (\u221293% p < 0.001 and \u221277% p < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: Overall, this study provides insightful data regarding the protective role of TOTUM-854 in human endothelial cells.

In those studies, changes in step length variability were secondary to changes in walking speed or step width variability.

Eighteen healthy young adults completed 5\u00a0min trials of treadmill walking at 1.20\u2005m\u2005s\u22121 while we manipulated their step length variability. Illuminated rectangles were projected onto the surface of a treadmill to cue step length variabilities of 0%, 5% and 10% coefficient of variation. Step length and its variability were tracked with reflective markers on the feet. Metabolic power across habitual (no projections) and the three variability conditions was measured using indirect calorimetry and analyzed using linear mixed effects modeling. Metabolic power was largest in the 10% condition (mean\u00b1s.d. 4.30\u00b10.23\u2005W\u2005kg\u22121) compared with 0% (4.16\u00b10.18\u2005W\u2005kg\u22121) and habitual (3.98\u00b10.25\u2005W\u2005kg\u22121).

For every 1% increase in step length variability, there was a 1.1% (0.05\u2005W\u2005kg\u22121; P<0.001) increase in metabolic power. Our results demonstrate an association between the metabolic cost of walking and step length variability.

A key aim of many programs is improving patients\u2019 self-efficacy. In-person lifestyle modification programs can enhance self-efficacy in managing CVD risk, also known as cardiac self-efficacy (CSE). However, such programs are typically staffing and resource intensive. Digital lifestyle modification programs may offer a scalable and accessible way to improve CSE, but this has not been shown in prior research.ObjectiveThis study examined changes in CSE among individuals using a digital lifestyle modification program for cardiovascular health. Evaluation of improvement in CSE was a secondary goal of a feasibility and acceptability pilot study of a digital program for Heart Health.MethodsParticipants were individuals with elevated risk for CVD who enrolled in a 90-day pilot study that involved mobile app\u2013based, artificial intelligence\u2013powered health coaching and educational lessons focused on behaviors that promote cardiovascular health.

Common sweeteners used individually or in combination include acesulfame-K, aspartame, cyclamate, saccharin, sucralose, and neotame. While traditionally considered harmless, emerging research suggest potential health implications. This study aims to analyze commonly consumed food products in Croatia for ASs presence, quantify four ASs, and estimate daily intake of ASs. Additionally, product labeling was assessed for compliance with Regulation 1169/2011 on food information to consumers. Methods: This study assessed the presence of acesulfame-K, aspartame, cyclamate, and saccharin dihydrate in 121 frequently consumed food products from the Croatian market using a high-performance liquid chromatography method. Based on obtained concentrations, data from a parallel consumption study, and existing literature on acceptable daily intake (ADI), we assessed exposure to ASs. Results: ASs were found in a substantial proportion of analyzed products, with multiple sweeteners often present in a single product. Specifically, ASs were detected in 74% of carbonated drinks, 54% of fruit juices, 86% of energy drinks, 70% of high-protein milk products, and 66% of chewing gums. Hypothetical consumption scenarios demonstrated that children, due to their low body mass, are at the highest risk of exceeding ADI values. Conclusions: The widespread presence of ASs in food products raises concerns about excessive intake, particularly among children who frequently consume soft drinks, instant beverages, and protein drinks. These findings highlight the need for further research into cumulative ASs exposure and its potential health effects, as well as the importance of public health strategies to regulate ASs consumption.",

Resistance exercise strategies that maximise the local accumulation of metabolites are not well defined, although high volume, close proximity to failure and shorter rests seem to be a necessity. Additionally, blood flow restriction training provides a potent alternative for inducing local acidosis, thereby triggering several pathways associated with improved immunity and physical function even in remote muscle tissues.

    "content": "BackgroundThe present study aims to investigate the association of smoking behaviors and cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), and to evaluate whether the cardiovascular benefits of smoking cessation vary across different CKM conditions.MethodsThis study included 242,636 white European participants from the UK Biobank who were classified as CKM syndrome Stages 0 to 3 and free of CVD at baseline. Covariates adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate the associations of CKM syndrome with the risks of total CVD, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and 13 CVD subtypes. The impact of smoking behavior across different CKM stages and the joint effect of smoking and CKM syndrome on CVD risk were also evaluated. To investigate the potential effect modification by CKM syndrome, we examined the multiplicative scale by interaction terms in Cox models, and quantified the additive scale using statistics such as the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI).ResultsThe risk of total CVD, stroke, and CHD increased progressively with advancing CKM stages, with Stage 3 associated with hazard ratios (HRs) of 3.38 (95% CI: 3.05\u20133.74), 3.01 (2.49\u20133.64), and 3.65 (3.25\u20134.10), respectively (P for trend\u2009<\u20090.001). The time required to reduce CVD risk to a level not significantly different from that of never smokers tends to be longer for individuals with advancing CKM stage: smokers at Stages 0\u20131 achieved this after approximately 10\u00a0years of cessation, whereas those at Stages 2\u20133 required more than 25\u00a0years. Compared with never smokers at CKM Stage 0, current smokers at CKM Stage 3 had substantially higher risk of total CVD (HR\u2009=\u20094.14, 95% CI: 3.54\u20134.83) and several subtypes, particularly abdominal aortic aneurysm (HR\u2009=\u200917.68, 95% CI: 6.33\u201349.43) and peripheral vascular disease (HR\u2009=\u200910.53, 95% CI: 6.79\u201316.34). CKM syndrome appeared to act as a positive additive effect modifier in smoking-related risk of total CVD (RERI\u2009=\u20090.20, 95% CI: 0.05\u20130.32), as well as several CVD subtypes, suggesting that the combined effect of smoking and CKM progression exceeds the sum of their individual effects.ConclusionsOur finding emphasizes the importance of smoking cessation among individuals with advanced CKM syndrome, as they face heightened CVD risk. However, compared to those at earlier CKM stages, the short-term benefits of smoking cessation may be less pronounced in this population. Interventions that combine smoking cessation promotion with CKM syndrome management may yield greater reductions in the risk of several CVD outcomes.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12889-025-22865-3.",

This study investigated the prevalence of HH and cardiovascular metabolic syndrome (MS) among patients with symptoms such as fatigue, joint pain, muscle weakness, vertigo, paresthesia, and aphthous stomatitis. The objective was to explore the associations between HH, MS, and quality of life, emphasizing the role of personalized dietary interventions.Patients and MethodsA prospective study was conducted between 2019 and 2023, including 86 patients aged 18 years or older who underwent nutrigenetic testing and provided anthropometric data. Participants were divided into three groups: those with HH (45.3%), those without HH or MS (31.4%), and those with MS but without HH (23.3%). Nutrigenetic analyses assessed genetic predispositions related to nutrient metabolism.ResultsPatients with HH exhibited reduced quality of life, with lower Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12) scores compared to other groups. Sex-specific nutrient needs and age-related changes in dietary requirements were identified. Metabolic conditions, including obesity, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, inversely impacted nutrient utilization. Physical activity positively correlated with higher demands for folic acid, vitamin B12, zinc, and magnesium.ConclusionNutritional interventions targeting these needs effectively improved metabolic health and alleviated symptoms. HH significantly impacts quality of life and metabolic health. Personalized dietary and lifestyle modifications tailored to genetic predispositions, sex, and age are critical for mitigating cardiometabolic risks. These findings lay the groundwork for targeted interventions aimed at improving health outcomes in individuals with HH and MS.",

The methylation status of this locus has been shown to be associated with periconceptional conditions, and both the methylation status and the levels of nc886 RNAs have been shown to associate with later-life health traits. We have previously shown that nc886 RNA levels are associated not only with the methylation status of the locus, but also with a genetic polymorphism upstream from the locus. In this study, we describe the genetic and epigenetic regulators that predict lifelong nc886 RNA levels, as well as their association with cardiometabolic disease (CMD) risk factors and events. We utilised six population cohorts and one CMD cohort comprising 9058 individuals in total. The association of nc886 RNA levels, as predicted by epigenetic and genetic regulators, with CMD phenotypes was analysed using regression models, with a meta-analysis of the results. The meta-analysis showed that individuals with upregulated nc886 RNA levels have higher diastolic blood pressure (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.07, p\u2009=\u20090.008), lower HDL levels (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2009\u2212\u20090.07, p\u2009=\u20090.006) and an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes (OR\u2009=\u20091.260, p\u2009=\u20090.013). Moreover, CMD patients with upregulated nc886 RNA levels have an increased incidence of stroke (OR\u2009=\u20091.581, p\u2009=\u20090.006) and death (OR\u2009=\u20091.290, p\u2009=\u20090.046). In conclusion, we show that individuals who are predicted to present elevated nc886 RNA levels have poorer cardiovascular health and are at an elevated risk of complications in secondary prevention. This unique mechanism yields metabolic variation in human populations, constituting a CMD risk factor that cannot be modified through lifestyle choices.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13148-025-01871-7.",

However, its potency as an anticancer agent in vivo has not been sufficiently explored.Materials and MethodsIn this study, we used cell proliferation assays, immunoblotting techniques, and light microscopy to study NB tumor cell cultures and human primary neonatal skin fibroblast control cells as well as a MYCN-amplified NB patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse tumor model to study the efficacy of allicin in vivo.ResultsAllicin strongly inhibits NB tumor cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner while non-cancerous human primary neonatal skin fibroblast control cells were largely unaffected. Importantly, two intra-tumoral injections of allicin over a two-week trial period significantly reduced the NB tumor burden in mice compared to controls (N=4-9 mice/group). Excised tumor tissues revealed that allicin treatment increased the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 protein levels, suggesting that in vivo, allicin increases p27Kip1-mediated G1/S cell cycle arrest.ConclusionOur findings warrant further preclinical development of allicin as a potential anticancer agent, especially for those types of cancers that are treatable by intra-tumoral injections, including neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, and medulloblastoma.",

This research aimed to investigate the phytochemicals and potential bioactivities, such as antimicrobial, thrombolytic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antidiarrheal properties of commonly available mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata Blanco) peel through experimental and computational techniques. Extensive chromatographic and 1H-NMR spectroscopic analysis was employed to isolate four purified compounds, which were characterized as tangeretin (A), nobiletin (B), limonin (C), and \u03b2-sitosterol (D). Furthermore, GC-MS/MS analysis detected over 90 compounds with a notable number of polymethoxyflavones, including nobiletin (29.04%), tangeretin (15.55%), artemetin (8.1%), 6-demethoxytangeretin (1.28%), sinensetin (0.95%), demethylnobiletin (0.14%), pebrellin (0.10%), and salvigenin (0.04%). Dichloromethane soluble fraction (DCMSF) exerted the highest antimicrobial potency Candia albicans against (20\u2009mm zone of inhibition) in the disk diffusion assay method. The aqueous soluble fraction (AQSF) exhibited 34.71% and 48.14% inhibition in hypotonic solution-induced and heat-induced hemolysis in the membrane stabilizing assay. Similarly, the AQSF exhibited the highest anti-thrombotic property with 32.57% clot lysis. The investigated 3 doses of the methanolic extracts (100, 200, and 400\u2009mg/kg body weight) exerted statistically significant in vivo central analgesic effects in a tail-flicking method in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, all the doses exhibited significant efficacy in inhibiting acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing and castor oil-induced diarrheal episodes in mouse models. The molecular docking studies corroborated the existing in vitro and in vivo findings by demonstrating better or comparable binding affinities toward the respective receptors and favorable pharmacokinetic properties and toxicological profiles. The present findings indicate that C. reticulata is a rich source of polymethoxyflavones, demonstrating potential efficacy against microbial infections, thrombosis, inflammation, pain, and diarrhea. Nonetheless, comprehensive phytochemical screening is imperative to identify additional bioactive compounds and evaluate their pharmacological effects against several chronic health conditions, grounded in their traditional uses and current evidence.",

This review provides a comprehensive analysis of key oxidative stress sources, focusing on NADPH oxidase (NOX) hyperactivity and mitochondrial Uncoupling Protein (UCP) downregulation. Critically, we examine the therapeutic potential of phytochemicals in mitigating NOX-mediated ROS generation through direct enzyme inhibition, including impacts on NOX subunit assembly and gene expression. Furthermore, we explore the ability of phytochemicals to bolster cellular antioxidant defenses by activating the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling pathway, elucidating the upregulation of antioxidant genes, such as GPx, SOD, CAT, and HO-1. This review expands beyond confined overviews; emphasizes specific molecular interactions between phytochemicals and target proteins, including NOX isoforms; and provides an in-depth analysis of the specific antioxidant genes upregulated via Nrf2. This approach aims to pave the way for targeted and translatable therapeutic strategies in neurodegenerative diseases.

At present, pharmacotherapy serves as the primary treatment approach for OUD. However, despite its status as a cornerstone of treatment, pharmacotherapy has certain limitations, thereby mandating the exploration of alternative modalities. This study evaluated the efficacy of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) in multiple cognitive domains in morphine\u2010withdrawn rats. To induce morphine dependence, the rats were administered 10\u2009mg/kg morphine for 10 consecutive days. taVNS was administered to the left ear of each rat and continued for 2\u2009weeks. After electrical stimulation, various cognitive and emotional functions were assessed through related behavioural tasks, including open field, Y\u2010maze, novel object recognition and elevated plus maze tests. GFAP, Iba1 and BDNF expression levels in the hippocampus were determined via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Our investigation revealed that taVNS ameliorated the impairment of working and recognition memory induced by morphine in behavioural tests. Additionally, it exerts an anxiolytic effect. Moreover, taVNS counteracted the decreased concentration of brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and elevated levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) caused by morphine. Nonetheless, taVNS applied only at a frequency of 100\u2009Hz has the potential to lower Iba1 levels independently of prior exposure to morphine. taVNS has been shown to exert a neuroprotective effect on morphine\u2010withdrawn rats. This outcome indicates that taVNS can be employed as a supplementary therapy with other pharmacological interventions for OUD.",

    "content": "The brain accounts for about 2% of the body\u2019s weight, but it consumes about 20% of the body\u2019s energy at rest, primarily derived from ATP produced in mitochondria. The brain thus has a high mitochondrial density in its neurons because of its extensive energy demands for maintaining ion gradients, neurotransmission, and synaptic activity. The brain is also extremely susceptible to damage and dysregulation caused by inflammation (neuroinflammation) and oxidative stress. Many systemic challenges to the brain can be mitigated by the phytochemical sulforaphane (SF), which is particularly important in supporting mitochondrial function. SF or its biogenic precursor glucoraphanin, from broccoli seeds or sprouts, can confer neuroprotective and cognitive benefits via diverse physiological and biochemical mechanisms. SF is able to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier as well as to protect it, and it mitigates the consequences of destructive neuroinflammation. It also protects against the neurotoxic effects of environmental pollutants, combats the tissue and cell damage wrought by advanced glycation end products (detoxication), and supports healthy glucose metabolism. These effects are applicable to individuals of all ages, from the developing brains in periconception and infancy, to cognitively, developmentally, and traumatically challenged brains, to those in later life as well as those who are suffering with multiple chronic conditions including Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s diseases.",

    "content": "Background: Phytic acid is abundant in plant-based diets and acts as a micronutrient inhibitor for humans and non-ruminant animals. Phytases are enzymes that break down phytic acid, releasing micronutrients and enhancing their bioavailability, particularly iron and zinc. Deficiencies in iron and zinc are significant public health problems, especially among populations with disease-associated malnutrition or those in developing countries consuming phytic acid-rich diets. This narrative review aimed to summarize findings from human intervention studies on the interactions between phytic acid, phytase, and micronutrient bioavailability. Methods: An extensive PubMed search (1 January 1990 to 8 February 2024) was conducted using MeSH terms (phytic acid, phytase, IP6, \u201cinositol hexaphosphate,\u201d micronutrient, magnesium, calcium, iron, zinc). Eligible studies included human intervention trials investigating the bioavailability of micronutrients following (a) phytase supplementation, (b) consumption of phytic acid-rich foods, or (c) consumption of dephytinized foods. In vitro, animal, cross-sectional, and non-English studies were excluded. Results: 3055 articles were identified. After the title and full-text review, 40 articles were eligible. Another 2 were identified after cross-checking reference lists from included papers, resulting in 42 included articles. Most studies exploring the efficacy of exogenous phytase (9 of 11, 82%) or the efficacy of food dephytinization (11 of 14, 79%) demonstrated augmented iron and zinc bioavailability. Most phytic acid-rich food-feeding studies (13 of 17, 77%) showed compromised iron and zinc bioavailability. Conclusions: Strong evidence supports decreased iron and zinc bioavailability in phytic acid-rich diets and significant improvements with phytase interventions. Studies of longer periods and within larger populations are needed.",

In Western countries, a significant number of people are overweight or obese, and this trend is, unfortunately, becoming increasingly common even among the pediatric population. In this narrative review, we analyzed the role of nutrition during growth and its impact on the risk of developing metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular complications later in life. An impactful role in determining the phenotypic characteristics of the offspring is the parental diet carried out before conception. During intrauterine growth, the main risk factors are represented by an unbalanced maternal diet, excessive gestational weight gain, and impaired glycemic status. Breastfeeding, on the other hand, has many beneficial effects, but at the same time the quality of breast milk may be modified if maternal overweight or obesity subsists. Complementary feeding is likewise pivotal because an early introduction before 4 months of age and a high protein intake contribute to weight gain later. Knowledge of these mechanisms may allow early modification of risk factors by implementing targeted preventive strategies.",

In this light, the present inquiry was designed to examine the various influences on the food behaviors of Indian primary school children.MethodsInformed by the socio-ecological framework, this study used an exploratory qualitative research approach to conduct semi-structured interviews with 22 primary school children, 19 mothers, and 18 teachers residing in Varanasi, India. For children, the interviews were preceded by a drawing session where the interviewees were asked to draw their preferred and non-preferred food and beverage items. Interviews were carried out in English or Hindi and digitally recorded. Interviews were conducted until data saturation was achieved. Digital recordings were transcribed verbatim and translated to English (where necessary) for the purpose of thematic analysis. The transcripts were coded both deductively and inductively using the NVivo software program.ResultsIndividual level influences included taste and nutritional knowledge. At the interpersonal level, the family food environment and peers emerged as key determinants. The physical environment also played a pivotal role in determining food behaviors, with the school food environment and food availability in the marketplace being significant. Lastly, at the societal level, television and internet advertisements were frequently cited as important determinants of children\u2019s food behavior.ConclusionsThe collective insights from the three stakeholder groups have the potential to inform public health nutrition policies and interventions targeting the different socio-ecological factors to encourage healthy eating in Indian primary school children.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12889-025-22660-0.",

Atopic diseases (ADs) are associated with systemic immunosuppressant medications and exposure to environmental allergens. However, the relationship between cancer survivorship and the prevalence of ADs remains poorly understood. This study investigated whether the prevalence of ADs is increased among cancer survivors. A cross-sectional survey was conducted using data from the 2021 US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The data were on 28,617 adults aged 18 years and older. Data analysis was performed between May 11, 2024, and July 30, 2024. The NHIS participants reported whether they had a history of current hay fever, still asthma, current skin allergy, and/or current food allergy. A history of cancer was defined on the basis of self-reported data from the NHIS. The weighted prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of ADs were calculated. Comparisons of AD prevalence between cancer survivors and the general population were conducted using chi-square tests and multiadjusted logistic regression models. Of the 28,617 adults sampled in the 2021 NHIS, the prevalence of ADs among the cancer survivors was as follows: current hay fever (54.5%; 95% CI, 52.6%\u201356.4%), persistent asthma (14.7%; 95% CI, 12.9%\u201313.9%), current skin allergy (13.6%; 95% CI, 10.1%\u201315.0%), and current food allergy (11.2%; 95% CI, 10.0%\u201312.4%). In multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, family income, educational level, insurance status, body mass index, general health status, region, location, and comorbidity burden, the cancer survivors had significantly higher odds of ADs than did the general population. In particular, they had higher odds of current hay fever (aOR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.05\u20131.23), persistent asthma (aOR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03\u20131.33), current skin allergy (aOR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.13\u20131.41), and current food allergy (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.08\u20131.38). The findings of this cross-sectional study indicated that the prevalence of ADs was significantly higher in cancer survivors than in the general population. Future research is required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, optimize treatment strategies, and enhance the overall well-being of individuals with ADs and a history of cancer.",

African American women were more likely to only FF. Regression analysis showed that the stronger predictors of failure to initiate BF were public healthcare assistance, African American race, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, neonatal hypoglycemia, prematurity and NICU admission.ConclusionAmong primiparous women with class 3 obesity who intended to BF only but failed to do so, the increased prevalence and severity of maternal and neonatal morbidities are likely obstacles to BF their first infant.",

    "content": "Background: Sweet almond expeller is an abundant protein resource, but there are few studies on multifunctional peptides. The purpose of this study is to improve its application in food and medical industries. Methods: This study investigated the identification, screening, and action mechanisms of antihypertensive peptides with antioxidant and ferrous binding activities derived from sweet almond globulin hydrolysates using intergrade in vitro and in silico methods and an animal model. Results: Eight novel oligopeptides were identified in sweet almond globulin hydrolysates subfraction D; of them, Pro-Met-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Gly-Met-Val (PMYGGGMV) exhibited ACE inhibitory activity (IC50: 121.16 \u03bcmol/L), ferrous binding ability (11.01 mg/g), and quenching capacities on hydroxyl (93.06%) and ABTS radicals (83.67%). The phenolic hydroxyl, amino, and carboxyl groups of PMYGGGMV were linked to Lys511, Tyr520, and Tyr523 in ACE\u2019s substrate binding center through four short hydrogen bonds. PMYGGGMV can inhibit the Kelch-like ECH-Associated Protein 1 (Keap1)-nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) interaction by binding to seven residues of Keap1 (including a key residue, Arg415). The ACE inhibitory and antioxidant activities of PMYGGMY were stable during gastrointestinal digestion. Ferrous chelation did not alter the ACE inhibitory and antihypertensive effects of PMYGGMY, but it reduced its ABTS and hydroxyl radical scavenging ability (p < 0.05). Additionally, PMYGGGMV reduced blood pressure of spontaneous hypertension rates and improved iron absorption across Caco-2 cells (p < 0.05). Conclusions: PMYGGGMV has the potential to prevent oxidative stress, hypertension, and iron deficiency.",

Fe-Fib PP, a stable and effective iron supplement, was fabricated based on the reducing property of pea protein fibrils, derived from pea protein through thermal treatment at pH 2.0. The results demonstrated that the reducing power of iron was remarkably affected by fibril concentration and fibrillization degree. The reducing power of pea protein fibrils gradually enhanced from 0.31 to 0.92 with the increase in incubation time from 0 to 48 h. Compared with iron nanoparticles (Fe\u2013Nano), Fe-Fib PP possessed much higher dispersibility. Additionally, the stability of iron in Fe-Fib PP was significantly higher than that in Fe\u2013Nano under different storage conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) outcomes revealed Fe (II) content in Fe-Fib PP (70.75 \u00b1 0.65%) was remarkably higher than that of Fe\u2013Nano (56.05 \u00b1 0.50%). In addition, the bioaccessibility of Fe (II) dramatically improved from 42.7% to 62.8% using PP fibrils as carriers. The findings suggest that Fe-Fib PP is an effective iron nutrition enhancer.",

Using marketing copy to gain insights into the ways immunity was presented to the public and normalised outside of medical institutions and publications, I offer four main areas of discussion. First, I present an analysis of the ways advertisements evoked both natural and artificial immunity in their marketing copy, thereby affording us insights into the ways immunity was made palatable both to those supportive of and opposed to vaccinations. I then unpack the ways in which this advertising copy often emphasised immunity rather than the immunological, that is, presented immunity as resistance to infection achieved by purchasing particular brands, rather than as part of a defensive process taking place at a cellular level. Third, I examine the ways in which advertisements engaged with futurity and drew on a narrative of social exclusion that pitted created communities of the immune against the non-immune. Finally, I analyse the ways in which immunity was used to connect the biological and the psychological, looking particularly at the ways immunity against worry was sold to the public.",

This study establishes a clear link between Hutten\u2019s reported symptoms and yaws, especially in its secondary and tertiary stages. The skeleton discovered in 1968 on Ufnau Island in Lake Zurich where Hutten died and was buried, exhibits distinct bone manifestations of ancient treponematosis with a pattern more consistent with yaws than syphilis. Furthermore, the correspondence between Hutten\u2019s main symptoms and the lesions observable on the 1968 skeleton further confirms the identification of these human remains. The historical evidence of yaws significantly contributes to our understanding of this early modern epidemic.",

They were randomly assigned to the control (CON) group (n =\u202f7) and CP group (n =\u202f7). Blood samples and fresh feces were collected at the end of the experimental period.ResultsThe results displayed that supplementation with CP increased the concentrations of serum immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (p\u202f< 0.05). However, there was no difference in the concentrations of serum amyloid A between the two groups (p >\u202f0.05). Furthermore, the serum biochemical parameters of all the kittens were within the reference range. The relative abundance of beneficial bacteria (norank_f__Butyricicoccaceae and Bacteroides plebeius) was higher in the CP group (p <\u202f0.05), while the opportunistic pathogen (Anaerotruncus) was lower in the CP group (p <\u202f0.05). In addition, serum metabolomic analysis demonstrated that the differential metabolites, including arachidonic acid, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, and glycine, and the relevant metabolic pathway, including glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, were implicated in regulating immune function in the kitten after CP treatment.ConclusionCP supplementation can enhance immune function in kittens and increase the relative abundance of beneficial gut microbiota, and does not lead to generalized inflammation. Dietary supplementation with CP may generate nutritional benefits in kittens, and this study offers insight into the development of functional pet food for kittens.",

Regulating these pathways is essential for mitigating systemic damage and improving outcomes. Natural products from tropical American plants have shown significant potential in modulating these hyperinflammatory responses. Key polyphenols, like quercetin and luteolin, found in plants such as Achyrocline satureioides and Mangifera indica demonstrate the downregulation of NF-\u03baB and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Alkaloids, such as berberine and mitraphylline, isolated from Berberis species and Uncaria tomentosa, respectively, have shown potent effects in suppressing nitric oxide production and regulating inflammasomes. Terpenoids, including parthenolide from Tanacetum parthenium and curcumol from Curcuma longa, exhibit multitarget activity, reducing cytokine levels and inhibiting key inflammatory enzymes like COX-2 and iNOS.

    "content": "BackgroundHelicobacter infection, which is the leading cause of gastritis and stomach cancer, has become common worldwide. Almost all Helicobacter-infected patients have chronic active gastritis, also known as Helicobacter-associated gastritis (HAG). However, the eradication rate of Helicobacter is decreasing due to the poor efficacy of current medications, which causes infection to recur, inflammation to persist, and stomach cancer to develop. Natural components have robust antibacterial activity and anti-inflammatory capacity, as confirmed by many studies of alternative natural medicines.PurposeThis article aimed to conduct a comprehensive search and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of anti-Helicobacter and anti-inflammatory activities of plant-derived extracts or compounds that can treat HAG in animal experiments. We intended to provide detailed preclinical-research foundation including plant and compound information, as well as the mechanisms by which these plant-derived substances inhibit the progression of Helicobacter infection, gastritis and neoplasms for future study.MethodsThe systematic review is aligned with the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, and the protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024527889). An extensive search was performed across multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Chinese Scientific Journal database (VIP), the Wanfang database, and the China biomedical literature service system (SinoMed), up until November 2023. Meta-analysis on Review Manager software (RevMan 5.4) estimating anti-Helicobacter and anti-inflammatory activity was performed. We used the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) risk of bias tool to evaluate the risk of bias of each study included.ResultsOur study encompassed 61 researches, comprised 36 extracts and 37 compounds improving HAG by inhibiting Helicobacter infection, the inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and regulating apoptosis and proliferation. Sixteen families especially Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Rosaceae and nine classes including Terpenoids, Alkaloids, Phenols, and Flavonoids may be promising directions for valuable new drugs. The Meta-analyse demonstrated the plant-base substance treatments possess significant anti-Helicobacter and anti-inflammation activity comparing to control groups. The included plants and compounds confirmed that signaling pathways NF-\u03baB, JAK2/STAT3, MAPK, TLR4/MyD88, PI3K/AKT, NLRP3/Caspase-1 and NRF2/HO-1 play a key role in the progression of HAG.ConclusionPlant-derived extracts or compounds actively improve HAG by modulating relevant mechanisms and signaling pathways, particularly through the anti-Helicobacter and inflammatory regulation ways. Further researches to apply these treatments in humans are needed, which will provide direction for the future development of therapeutic drugs to increase eradication rate and alleviate gastritis.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13020-025-01093-2.",

In Italy, diverse pedo-climatic conditions and historical\u2013cultural fragmentation have led to the development of various garlic landraces, prized for their unique organoleptic qualities and cultural importance. This study aimed to assess the intra-varietal diversity and uniqueness of two red garlic landraces from the Lazio region in central Italy, \u201cAglio Rosso di Castelliri\u201d and \u201cAglio Rosso di Proceno\u201d, using SSR and ISSR molecular markers, along with evaluations of bulb morphological traits, total phenolic content, and antioxidant properties. The molecular analysis included 11 accessions of \u201cAglio Rosso di Castelliri\u201d, nine of \u201cAglio Rosso di Proceno\u201d, and 15 control accessions, comprising eight Italian red-type garlic landraces, four Spanish red garlic commercial varieties, two white garlic accessions, and an accession of A. ampeloprasum var. holmense used as an outgroup. SSR and ISSR markers revealed moderate genetic diversity within the collection, with mean PIC values of 0.41 and 0.17, respectively. The molecular data identified four distinct genetic clusters, with the two Lazio landraces forming separate groups, indicating their genetic distinctiveness. The results from the STRUCTURE analysis support the hypothesis that these landraces may have originated from the widely cultivated \u201cAglio Rosso di Sulmona\u201d or a common ancestral population once prevalent in central Italy. The study also revealed significant intra-population genetic diversity within the two garlic landraces, underscoring the need for in situ conservation and clonal selection. Phenotypic evaluations confirmed the distinctiveness of the two landraces, with \u201cAglio Rosso di Castelliri\u201d characterized by smaller bulbs and cloves with higher dry matter content and distinct color profiles. Additionally, significant variation in total phenolic content and antioxidant activity was observed by analyzing 13 selected accessions from the two landraces (six from \u201cAglio Rosso di Proceno\u201d and seven from \u201cAglio Rosso di Castelliri\u201d) and five red garlic control accessions, with the two Lazio landraces exhibiting higher levels than the control group. This study highlights the importance of integrating molecular, phenotypic, and chemical analyses to understand garlic landrace diversity, with significant implications for their conservation and protection of local agro-food products.",

    "content": "Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a bioactive compound known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, and metabolic effects, with growing interest in its role in supporting bone health. Preclinical studies, particularly those involving the t10c12 isomer, have shown that CLA can enhance bone mineral density (BMD) by enhancing bone formation and reducing bone resorption, indicating its potential as a therapeutic agent to improve bone health. However, clinical trials have yielded inconsistent results, underscoring the difficulty in translating animal model successes to human applications. A major challenge is CLA\u2019s low water solubility, poor absorption, and limited bioavailability, which restrict its therapeutic effectiveness. To address these issues, nanoparticle-based delivery systems have been proposed to improve its solubility, stability, and resistance to oxidative damage, thereby enhancing its bioactivity. Recent studies also suggest that electrical stimulation can stimulate bone regeneration by promoting bone cell proliferation, differentiation, and adherence to scaffolds. This review explores the combined use of CLA supplementation and electrical stimulation as a novel approach to improving bone health, particularly in osteoporosis management. By integrating CLA\u2019s biological effects with the regenerative potential of electrical stimulation, this multimodal strategy offers a promising method for enhancing bone restoration, with significant implications for clinical applications in bone health.",

The unique genetic profile of each individual influences the composition of the oral microbiota, determining susceptibility to certain diseases. The aim is to observe its role by highlighting the pathogenic mechanisms involved in oral dysbiosis and identify genetic determinism\u2019s influence in maintaining balance. Methods: This study was designed as a narrative review of the oral microbiota, utilizing some of the principles and guidelines of systematic review to increase methodological rigor. We examined 121 articles such as reviews, meta-analyses, editorials, and observational studies, which met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria for studies were as follows: (1) studies that evaluated the impact of the microbiota in oral or/and systemic diseases; (2) studies that observed pathogenic mechanisms in the oral microbiota; (3) studies that evaluated the interaction of the microbiota with the immune system (4); studies that evaluated genetic implications in the microbiota. Results: Host genes regulate inflammatory and immunological reactions that play a role in microbiological balance. This explains the increased resistance of some to diseases, including gingivitis or periodontitis. Also, the implications of oral dysbiosis are reflected not only locally, but also generally, being associated with various systemic conditions. Conclusions: Understanding the pathogenic mechanisms and genetic determinants involved in oral dysbiosis may help create individualized therapies for preventing and managing oral and systemic disorders. A healthy lifestyle and adequate oral hygiene can facilitate a diverse and balanced microbiome, crucial for overall health.",

    "content": "Background/Objectives: Metabolic bone disease of prematurity (MBDP) is a multifactorial disorder resulting from disrupted transplacental mineral transfer and postnatal nutritional deficits, particularly affecting preterm neonates born before 32 weeks of gestation or weighing under 1500 g. Although substantial research has focused on skeletal outcomes, few studies have explored the association between MBDP and neonatal neurological impairment. This narrative review is the first to integrate the pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic methods, and preventive strategies for MBDP, while simultaneously investigating its potential impact on neurodevelopment. Methods: A narrative review of recent peer-reviewed studies, systematic reviews, and clinical trials was performed focusing on biochemical markers (alkaline phosphatase, FGF23, calcium, and phosphorus), emerging tools such as bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and the effects of early nutritional interventions on both skeletal and neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants (n = seven included articles). Results: Early elevations in ALP, particularly when combined with low serum phosphorus and FGF23 levels, provide sensitive markers for identifying MBDP. Furthermore, insufficient vitamin D levels during gestation and in the neonatal period have been associated with increased risks of seizures, hypotonia, and developmental delays. Studies suggest that enhanced vitamin D supplementation in preterm infants (up to 800 IU/day) may improve mineral absorption and bone formation and confer neuroprotective benefits through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms. Conclusions: This is the first review on the neurological implications of biochemical actors of MBDP. As a result, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including vitamin D supplementation, can improve bone and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Future prospective studies are required to standardize diagnostic criteria and optimize therapeutic regimens for enhanced long-term benefits.",

    "content": "Bone diseases profoundly affect patients, particularly the elderly, leading to severe health complications and disabilities. Osteoblasts play a crucial role in bone formation and are ideal candidates for treating bone diseases and engineering living materials. However, the stem and progenitor cells that give rise to osteoblasts, as well as osteoblasts themselves, exhibit dysfunction with aging. Although chemical reprogramming of fibroblasts into osteoblasts has been achieved, effective cell-based therapies or living materials have not been established in clinical practice. Here, we present a method to engineer fibroblasts through small molecule reprogramming and spheronization, achieving functional osteoblastic materials across all age groups. By primarily targeting the WNT signaling pathway and modularizing small molecules based on their effects on stage-specific genes, we optimized the temporal regulation of small molecules during reprogramming, acquiring a large number of healthy induced osteoblasts (iOBs). These iOBs with traits of functional native osteoblasts are ideal for forming transplantable tissue spheroids. As innovative living materials, the iOB spheroids (iOB-Sps) have demonstrated improved survival, significant self-bone formation, reduced ROS levels in the defect microenvironment, and accelerated endogenous osteogenesis and angiogenesis in vivo, promoting effective healing of bone defects. These material-free iOB-Sps function as self-scaffolding building blocks for biofunctional constructs, offering a promising avenue for clinical autologous bone defect repair, especially for the elderly.",

    "content": "Objective:The increasing demand for precision medicine has spurred molecular diagnostic investigations to emphasize the utility of miRNA as significant biomarkers. Recent studies have underscored miRNA\u2019s role as prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic biomarkers in managing and monitoring multiple myeloma patients. This review aims to present the latest insights on the potential of circulating miRNA as prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic biomarkers in bortezomib-resistant multiple myeloma.Methods:For this purpose, a comprehensive thematic literature review from January 2014 and August 2024 was conducted utilizing the databases CINAHL, Pubmed, and Google Scholar. Twenty pertinent studies were meticulously analyzed and categorized into the following sections: Bortezomib (BTZ) resistance in multiple myeloma, the predictive role of miRNAs in BTZ resistance, the impact of circulating miRNAs in multiple myeloma, and the potential of circulating miRNA as prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic biomarkers.Results:Of note, eight studies identified circulating miRNAs as diagnostic miRNA biomarkers (i.e., miR-744, miR-130a, let-7d, let-7e, miR-34a, etc.). In comparison, nine studies identified several circulating miRNAs that can be used as prognostic biomarkers (i.e., miR-20a, miR-483-5p, mir-1246, let-7a, let-7e, etc.). Moreover, five studies identified circulating miRNAs as promising therapeutic biomarkers (i.e., mir-15a, mir-92a, mir-19a, etc.). This discovery can significantly enhance early detection, accurate diagnosis, prognosis, overall survival rates, and quality of life for patients with multiple myeloma.Conclusion:Based on this evidence, exploring circulating miRNAs as a potential noninvasive biomarker for multiple myeloma represents a noteworthy advancement. This is attributed to the abundance of miRNAs in plasma or serum, which exhibits remarkable stability against enzymatic degradation.",

    "content": "Bone health is an emerging concern in the aging human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected population. We aimed to investigate bone mineral density (BMD) and bone microarchitecture in persons living with HIV (PLHIV). The study was a cross-sectional study. BMD and bone microarchitecture were investigated by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) at the hip and lumbar spine and High-Resolution peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HRpQCT) at the radius and tibia. Information about risk factors for fracture was obtained from a questionnaire. 183 PLHIV were included, 160 (131 males, 29 females) completed the visit. Age range was 30\u201378\u00a0years and the mean time since first HIV-positive serology was 16.5\u00a0years. 47% had low bone density and 6% had osteoporosis. The mean T-score by DXA was \u2212\u00a01.2 (standard deviation (SD)\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0), \u2212\u00a00.7 (SD\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9), and \u2212\u00a00.7 (SD\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3) at the femoral neck, total hip and lumbar spine, respectively. We observed no significant difference in BMD by DXA between participants below or above age 50. BMI was significantly lower in PLHIV with lower BMD (p\u2009=\u20090.001, ANOVA). HRpQCT measurements showed significant differences in cortical area, volumetric BMD, and most microarchitecture parameters between PLHIV with BMD in the normal, low, and osteoporotic ranges measured at the tibia and radius. Our results indicate that bone microarchitecture and BMI vary considerably between PLHIV with normal, low, and osteoporotic BMD. These differences may partly explain the increased fracture risk seen in PLHIV.Trial numbers: Ethics Committee of the Central Denmark Region (case no. 1-10-72-238-17), Danish Data Protection Agency (case no. 1-16-02-708-17).Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00223-025-01368-8.",

However, its molecular mechanisms remain unclear.PurposeThis study investigates the effects of QRHSD on DSS-induced colitis in mice, employing multi-omics analyses, including RNA-seq transcriptomics, 16S rRNA microbiomics, non-targeted metabolomics, and network pharmacology analysis.MethodsThe chemical composition of QRHSD was analyzed using quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS). A UC mice model was induced by 3% DSS for 7 days. The effects and mechanisms of QRHSD on UC were evaluated via hematoxylin and eosin, immunofluorescence assay, flow cytometry, western blot, RNA-seq transcriptomics, 16S rRNA microbiomics, non-targeted metabolomics, and network pharmacology. Correlation analyses and validation experiments explored links between transcriptomic, microbiome, metabolomic profiles, and UC-related clinical indices.ResultsUPLC-Q-TOF/MS identified 55 compounds in QRHSD. QRHSD significantly reduced clinical activity, histological changes, and inflammatory factors in UC mice, regulated Th17/Treg balance, and enhanced intestinal barrier integrity. 16S rRNA analysis showed that QRHSD altered gut microbiota composition, increasing beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus) and decreasing harmful bacteria (e.g., Morganella). Non-targeted metabolomics revealed 507 metabolites associated with UC amelioration, enriched in pathways like bile secretion, ABC transporters, and amino acid biosynthesis. RNA-seq analysis, network pharmacology, and experimental verification showed that QRHSD significantly regulated key signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, NF-\u03baB, and MAPK signaling pathways. Finally, correlation analysis highlighted connections among UC-related clinical factors, gut microbiota, and metabolites.ConclusionQRHSD could modulate the gut microbiota, metabolic homeostasis, and multiple signal pathways in the treatment of DSS-induced UC, revealing the mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine therapy for UC.",

    "content": "Background: The dark green coloration of bunching onion leaf blades is a key determinant of market value, nutritional quality, and visual appeal. This trait is regulated by a complex network of pigment interactions, which not only determine coloration but also serve as critical indicators of plant growth dynamics and stress responses. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms regulating the dark green trait and develop a predictive model for accurately assessing pigment composition. These advancements enable the efficient selection of dark green varieties and facilitate the establishment of optimal growth environments through plant growth monitoring. Methods: Seven varieties and lines of heat-tolerant bunching onions were analyzed, including two commercial F1 cultivars, along with two purebred varieties and three F1 hybrid lines bred in Yamaguchi Prefecture. The analysis was conducted on visible spectral reflectance data (400\u2013700 nm at 20 nm intervals) and pigment compounds (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and pheophytin a, lutein, and \u03b2-carotene), whereas primary and secondary metabolites were assessed by using widely targeted metabolomics. In addition, a random forest regression model was constructed by using spectral reflectance data and pigment compound contents. Results: Principal component analysis based on spectral reflectance data and the comparative profiling of 186 metabolites revealed characteristic metabolite accumulation associated with each green color pattern. The \u201cgreen\u201d group showed greater accumulation of sugars, the \u201cgray green\u201d group was characterized by the accumulation of phenolic compounds, and the \u201cdark green\u201d group exhibited accumulation of cyanidins. These metabolites are suggested to accumulate in response to environmental stress, and these differences are likely to influence green coloration traits. Furthermore, among the regression models for estimating pigment compound contents, the one for chlorophyll a content achieved high accuracy, with an R2 value of 0.88 in the test dataset and 0.78 in Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation, demonstrating its potential for practical application in trait evaluation. However, since the regression model developed in this study is based on data obtained from greenhouse conditions, it is necessary to incorporate field trial results and reconstruct the model to enhance its adaptability. Conclusions: This study revealed that cyanidin is involved in the characteristics of dark green varieties. Additionally, it was demonstrated that chlorophyll a can be predicted using visible spectral reflectance. These findings suggest the potential for developing markers for the dark green trait, selecting high-pigment-accumulating varieties, and facilitating the simple real-time diagnosis of plant growth conditions and stress status, thereby enabling the establishment of optimal environmental conditions. Future studies will aim to elucidate the genetic factors regulating pigment accumulation, facilitating the breeding of dark green varieties with enhanced coloration traits for summer cultivation.",

    "content": "Non-alcoholic wine is becoming popular as a healthier alternative to traditional wine, offering potential health benefits without the risks of alcohol consumption. Sensory attributes, such as taste and aroma, significantly influence consumer preferences, with sweet, sour, and balanced fragrances favored over bitter or medicinal notes. A lower alcohol content can enhance the complexity of sensory properties, suggesting that non-alcoholic wines provide an appealing experience. Moderate consumption, particularly of red wine, has been linked to reduced cardiovascular mortality, attributed to phenolic compounds like resveratrol and quercetin present in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic wines. These bioactive components are associated with reduced risks of chronic diseases by modulating biochemical pathways and gene expression. Health-conscious consumers are increasingly taking these benefits into account in their purchasing decisions. Non-alcoholic wines may appeal to individuals seeking health benefits without the presence of alcohol. While some evidence supports the health advantages of wine, most research is observational, and the specific benefits of non-alcoholic options need further investigation. Challenges include isolating the effects of wine\u2019s bioactive compounds from other factors and creating appealing non-alcoholic wines through innovative fermentation techniques, such as using non-Saccharomyces yeast strains.

Thus, a panel of blood and urinary biomarkers for the evaluation of acrylamide exposure was deemed appropriate.\n\n\nObjective:\nThe study was designed to evaluate daily acrylamide exposure in US adults via hemoglobin adducts and urinary metabolites using a pharmacokinetic framework.\n\n\nMethods:\nA cohort of 2798 subjects aged 20\u201379 was selected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2013\u20132016) for analysis. Three acrylamide biomarkers including hemoglobin adducts of acrylamide in blood and two urine metabolites, N-Acetyl-S-(2-carbamoylethyl)cysteine (AAMA) and N-Acetyl-S-(2-carbamoyl-2-hydroxyethyl)-l-cysteine (GAMA) were used to estimate daily acrylamide exposure using validated pharmacokinetic prediction models. Multivariate regression models were also used to examine key factors in determining estimated acrylamide intake.\n\n\nResults:\nThe estimated daily acrylamide exposure varied across the sampled population. Estimated acrylamide daily exposure was comparable among the three different biomarkers (median: 0.4\u20130.7 \u03bcg/kg/d). Cigarette smoking emerged as the leading contributor to the acquired acrylamide dose. Smokers had the highest estimated acrylamide intake (1.20\u20131.49 \u03bcg/kg/d) followed by passive smokers (0.47\u20130.61) and non-smokers (0.45\u20130.59). Several covariates, particularly, body mass index and race/ethnicity, played roles in determining estimated exposures.\n\n\nDiscussion:\nEstimated daily acrylamide exposures among US adults using multiple acrylamide biomarkers were similar to populations reported elsewhere providing additional support for using the current approach in assessing acrylamide exposure. This analysis assumes that the biomarkers used indicate intake of acrylamide into the body, which is consistent with the substantial known exposures due to diet and smoking. Although this study did not explicitly evaluate background exposure arising from analytical or internal biochemical factors, these findings suggest that the use of multiple biomarkers may reduce uncertainties regarding the ability of any single biomarker to accurately represent actual systemic exposures to the agent. This study also highlights the value of integrating a pharmacokinetic approach into exposure assessments.",

VD levels were similar, with Group A averaging 10.03 \u00b1 5.43 ng/mL and Group B 10.01 \u00b1 5.09 ng/mL (p = 0.986). Group A's mean PTH\u00a0level was 79.71 \u00b1 57.64 ng/mL, while Group B's was 59.42 \u00b1 45.57 ng/mL (p = 0.018). Among patients with diabetes, 60% were on oral medications, 6.2% on insulin alone, and 16.9% received a combination of treatments. Elderly diabetes patients with hip fractures, those using insulin, or those newly diagnosed with T2DM had lower VD levels. Based on regression analysis, VD is expected to decrease by 0.029 for every unit increase in PTH, concerning all the participants (95% confidence interval: 0.011-0.048). HbA1c and HOMA-IR levels showed significant differences (p < 0.001). Patients with diabetes experienced more unstable fractures (75.4% in diabetics vs. 67.3% in nondiabetics), though fracture type and severity were not statistically significant. More comminuted fractures were noted in patients on oral antidiabetic medications alongside insulin usage and those with less than five years of antidiabetic therapy. ALB levels were similar, with malnutrition prevalent in 75.5% of Group A and 75.4% of Group B patients. Patients with diabetes with malnutrition exhibited lower VD levels compared to those with normal ALB (p = 0.038). Patients with diabetes with poor glycemic control (HbA1c > 6.5%) had higher VD (10.09 \u00b1 4.93 vs. 9.82 \u00b1 5.57 ng/mL) and PTH (58.9 \u00b1 49.99 vs. 50.73 \u00b1 34.01 ng/mL) levels compared to those with adequate control (p values not significant).Conclusions:\u00a0Our study confirmed the paradox that patients with T2DM had increased BMD\u00a0compared to age-adjusted nondiabetic counterparts. The difference in hip fracture severity was not statistically significant. ALB levels were similar, with malnutrition prevalent in both groups, although diabetic patients with malnutrition are correlated with lower VD levels. VD levels were similar in both groups, but PTH\u00a0levels were significantly higher in nondiabetics. The relationship between T2DM and PTH remains controversial and needs further investigation. Clinicians should note that low VD levels do not accompany elevated PTH in patients with diabetes, and elevated PTH may indicate poorly controlled T2DM. VD deficiency, hypoalbuminemia, and impaired glycemic control are interconnected issues in elderly patients with low-energy hip fractures.",

Five IR indices were calculated. Weighted logistic regression, restricted cubic spline, and mediation analyses were used to assess the independent associations between these indices and the risk of kidney stones and recurrence in non-diabetic individuals.ResultThis study of 9,605 non-diabetic participants showed an overall kidney stones incidence of 8.63% and a recurrence rate of 2.70%. Weighted logistic regression and RCS analyses revealed significant positive associations between METs-IR, HOMA-IR, TyG-BMI, and the risk of kidney stones and their recurrence. Every unit increase in METs-IR was linked to a 2% rise in the incidence of kidney stones (95% CI: 1.014\u20131.027, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and a 3.3% rise in recurrence (95% CI: 1.018\u20131.048, p\u2009<\u20090.001); each unit increase in HOMA-IR raised incidence by 5% (95% CI: 1.025\u20131.078, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and recurrence by 7.9% (95% CI: 1.041\u20131.118, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Adjusting for confounders shifted these relationships from nonlinear to linear (p\u2009>\u20090.05). METs-IR demonstrated the strongest diagnostic accuracy for predicting recurrence, with uric acid and vitamin D mediating associations between IR indices and the risk of kidney stones and their recurrence in non-diabetic individuals.ConclusionThis study found that elevated IR indices (METs-IR, HOMA-IR, TyG-BMI) significantly increased kidney stone risk in a non-diabetic population. Serum uric acid and vitamin D mediated this association, with METs-IR best predicting kidney stones incidence and recurrence.",

This study evaluated the effects of gold and silver mNPs in combination with gliadin on crypt-like cells (HIEC-6). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to evaluate gliadin-mNP aggregates in cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis assessed autophagy-related molecule levels (p62, LC3, beclin-1, EGFR). Lysosome functionality was tested with acridine orange (AO) and Magic Red assays. TEM identified an increase in autophagic vacuoles after exposure to gliadin + mNPs, as also detected by significant increments in LC3-II and p62 expression. Immunofluorescence confirmed the presence of mature autophagosomes, showing LC3 and p62 colocalization, indicating an altered autophagic flux, further assessed with EGFR degradation, AO and Magic Red assays. The results showed a significant reduction in lysosomal enzyme activity and a modest reduction in acidity. Thus, gliadin + mNPs can block the autophagic flux inducing a lysosomal defect. The alteration of this pathway, essential for cell function, can lead to cell damage and death. The potential effects of this copresence in food should be further characterized to avoid a negative impact on celiac disease subjects.",

    "content": "Simple Summary\nColon cancer is a multifactorial disease involving genetic, environmental and lifestyle risk factors. Despite being one of the most common malignancies and a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, its underlying molecular mechanisms are scarcely known, highlighting the need to identify novel biomarkers for the clinical detection of its initiation and progression. The aim of the current study was to elucidate the role of the protein reelin in colon cancer initiation and progression using mouse models and human samples that extend from colitis or precancerous lesions to colon cancer. The results might contribute to understanding the mechanisms involved in colon cancer, and suggest that reelin may be a biomarker of colon pathology progression.\n\n\nAbstract\nPrevious observations made in human and mouse colons suggest that reelin protects the colon from pathology. In this study, we evaluated reelin expression during the transition from either colitis or precancerous lesions to colon cancer and tried to elucidate reelin regulation under these transition processes. Samples of healthy and pathological colons from humans and mice treated with either azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) or azoxymethane alone were used. The relative abundances of reelin, DNMT-1 and ApoER2 mRNAs were determined by PCR in the colon samples cited above and in the tissue adjacent to mouse colon polyps and adenocarcinomas. In both, humans and mice, reelin mRNA abundance increased significantly in ulcerative colitis and slightly in polyps and decreased in adenomas and adenocarcinomas. Reelin expression was higher in the tissue adjacent to the colon adenocarcinoma and lower in the lesion itself. The reelin expression changes may result, at least in part, from those in DNMT-1 and appear to be independent of ApoER2. Lack of reelin downregulated p-Akt and p53 in healthy colon and prevented their increases in the inflamed colon, whereas it increased GSK-3\u03b2 in DSS-untreated mice. In conclusion, reelin mRNA abundance depends on the severity of the colon pathology, and its upregulation in response to initial injuries might prevent the beginning of colon cancer, whereas reelin repression favors it. Increased p53 expression and activation may be involved in this protection. We also propose that changes in colon reelin abundance could be used to predict colon pathology progression.",

    "content": "Background\nOral iron supplementation is commonly prescribed for anemia and may play an important role in the gut microbiota recovery of anemic individuals who received antibiotic treatment. This study aims to investigate the effects of iron supplementation on gut microbiota recovery after antibiotics exposure.\n\n\nResults\nMice were subjected to oral antibiotic treatment with neomycin and metronidazole and were fed diets with different concentrations of iron. The composition of the gut microbiota was followed throughout treatment by 16S rRNA sequencing of DNA extracted from fecal samples. Gut microbiota functions were inferred using PICRUSt2, and short-chain fatty acid concentration in fecal samples was assessed by liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry. Iron supplementation after antibiotic exposure shifted the gut microbiota composition towards a Bacteroidetes phylum-dominant composition. At the genus level, the iron-supplemented diet induced an increase in the abundance of Parasutterella and Bacteroides, and a decrease of Bilophila and Akkermansia. Parasutterella excrementihominis, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Alistipes finegoldii, were more abundant with the iron excess diet. Iron-induced shifts in microbiota composition were accompanied by functional modifications, including an enhancement of the biosynthesis of primary bile acids, nitrogen metabolism, cyanoamino acid metabolism and pentose phosphate pathways. Recovery after antibiotic treatment increased propionate levels independent of luminal iron levels, whereas butyrate levels were diminished by excess iron.\n\n\nConclusions\nOral iron supplementation after antibiotic therapy in mice may lead to deleterious changes in the recovery of the gut microbiota. Our results have implications on the use of oral iron supplementation after antibiotic exposure and justify further studies on alternative treatments for anemia in these settings.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12866-021-02320-0.",

    "content": "Chronic pain, defined by persistent pain beyond normal healing time, is a pervasive and debilitating condition affecting up to 30\u201350% of adults globally. In parallel, neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and cognitive or motor decline, often underpinned by pathological protein misfolding and aggregation. Emerging evidence suggests a potential mechanistic link between chronic pain and NDs, with persistent pain contributing to neuroinflammatory states and protein homeostasis disturbances that mirror processes in neurodegeneration. This review explores the hypothesis that protein misfolding and aggregation serve as a mechanistic bridge between chronic pain and neurodegeneration. We systematically examine molecular pathways of protein misfolding, proteostasis dysfunction in chronic pain, and shared neuroimmune mechanisms, highlighting prion-like propagation of misfolded proteins, chronic neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress as common denominators. We further discuss evidence from experimental models and clinical studies linking chronic pain to accelerated neurodegenerative pathology\u2014including tau accumulation, amyloid dysregulation, and microglial activation\u2014and consider how these insights open avenues for novel therapeutics. Targeting protein aggregation, enhancing chaperone function, modulating the unfolded protein response (UPR), and attenuating glial activation are explored as potential strategies to mitigate chronic pain and possibly slow neurodegeneration. Understanding this intersection not only elucidates chronic pain\u2019s role in cognitive decline but also suggests that interventions addressing proteostasis and inflammation could yield dual benefits in pain management and neurodegenerative disease modification.",

How such tiny mammals achieve this unique brain size plasticity while maintaining activity through the winter remains unknown. To discover potential adaptations underlying this trait, we analyzed seasonal differential gene expression in the shrew hypothalamus, a brain region that both regulates metabolic homeostasis and drastically changes size, and compared hypothalamus gene expression across species. We discovered seasonal variation in suites of genes involved in energy homeostasis and apoptosis, shrew-specific upregulation of genes involved in the development of the hypothalamic blood-brain barrier and calcium signaling, as well as overlapping seasonal and comparative gene expression divergence in genes implicated in the development and progression of human neurological and metabolic disorders, including CCDC22. With high metabolic rates and facing harsh winter conditions, S. araneus have evolved both adaptive and plastic mechanisms to sense and regulate their energy budget. Many of these changes mirrored those identified in human neurological and metabolic disease, highlighting the interactions between metabolic homeostasis, brain size plasticity, and longevity.",

Two group of participants were included in this study. The first group (n=100 patients) consisted of patients diagnosed with different stages of ARMD, and second, control group (n=100 patients) consisted of patients without ARMD. The study included subjects of both sexes, divided into three age categories (\u226455; 56-66; \u226567 years). Detailed ocular and systemic evaluations were performed, including fundus examination and OCT angiography. A 5mL sample of venous blood was colected to determine serum CRP levels, for the both group of patients, using latex immunoassay method. Statistical analysis, including Student\u2019s t-test, Chi square test and posthoc (Turkey) tests, was conducted using SPSS 26 for Windows, with p<0,05 considered significant. Results:Out of 100 patients, 34 were having early, 18 intermediate and 48 were having advanced stages of ARMD. The mean serum CRP levels in the ARMD group (8.39\u00b127.22mg/L) were significantly higher compared to the control group, (2.52\u00b15.35mg/L), p=0,000. Also, serum CRP values by age category, between ARMD subjects and the control group, showed statistically significant differences in all age groups: \u226455 p=0.032; 56-66 p=0.019; \u226567 p=0.000. The mean serum CRP levels was 6.6\u00b16.9 mg/L, 10\u00b113.3 mg/L and 16\u00b122.7 mg/L, in early, intermediate and advanced ARMD, respectively. Comparing these CRP values and different stages of ARMD, there were found statistically significant differences between the three stages. Furthermore, these results showed that mean CRP values increase with disease severity.Conclusion:Based on the obtained results serum CRP levels are significant risk factor in predicting the development and the progression of ARMD. Also, these results emphasize the role of systemic inflammation in the development and progression of ARMD.",

We compared the risks of the different reasons for transfer to hemodialysis in patients on PD according to the use of assistance for PD care, PD modality, and the suboptimal starter status.MethodsThis was a retrospective study using data from the French Language PD Registry from patients who started PD between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2018. We used Cox and Fine\u2013Gray survival models to evaluate the risks of transfer to hemodialysis due to PD inadequacy, infection, mechanical issue, psychosocial issue, other PD-related causes, and other non\u2013PD-related causes. Models were evaluated for three periods of PD vintage: 0\u20136 months, 6\u201318 months, and after 18 months.ResultsThe study included 15,974 patients on incident PD treated in 170 French PD units. There were 6835 deaths, 5108 transfers to hemodialysis, and 3092 renal transplantations. Nurse-assisted PD was associated with a lower risk of transfer to hemodialysis for infection in the first 18 months (cause-specific hazard ratio [cs-HR], 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31 to 0.83 before 6 months) and for adequacy issues after 6 months (cs-HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.70 after 18 months). The risk of transfer for mechanical issue was higher in continuous ambulatory PD compared with automated PD during the first 18 months (cs-HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.99 before 6 months), but continuous ambulatory PD was associated with a lower risk of adequacy, infectious, or mechanical issue after 18 months. Finally, suboptimal starters have a higher risk of transfer due to psychosocial challenges in the first 6 months (cs-HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.81).ConclusionsDistinct factors are associated with the risk of transfer from PD to in-center hemodialysis, according to the cause of the transfer.

    "content": "Ferroptosis is a unique mode of cell death driven by iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation, and its mechanism primarily involves disturbances in iron metabolism, imbalances in the lipid antioxidant system and accumulation of lipid peroxides. Protein processing, modification and folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are closely related regulatory processes that determine cell function, fate and survival. The uncontrolled proliferative capacity of malignant cells generates an unfavorable microenvironment characterized by high metabolic demand, hypoxia, nutrient deprivation and acidosis, which promotes the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the ER, leading to ER stress (ERS). Ferroptosis and ERS share common pathways in several diseases, and the two interact to affect cell survival and death.

Ferroptosis and ERS in ovarian cancer (OC) have attracted increasing research interest; however, both are discussed separately regarding OC. The present review aims to summarize the associations and potential links between ferroptosis and ERS, aiming to provide research references for the development of therapeutic approaches for the management of OC.",

Spirulina-derived nanoparticles (sNPs) have shown promise as a targeted anticancer strategy.MethodsThis study evaluated the cytotoxic effects of sNPs on cancer cell lines TR-146 (buccal), Caco-2 and HT-29 (colorectal), and MCF-7 (breast), compared to the non-cancerous MCF-10A cells. Cytotoxicity was assessed using the XTT assay at concentrations of 25\u2013500 mg/mL over 3\u201348\u00a0hours. Cellular uptake was quantified via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and fluorescence microscopy, and endocytic inhibitors were used to investigate the uptake mechanism.ResultssNPs induced 30\u201380% mortality in cancer cells, while non-cancerous MCF-10A cells exhibited negligible mortality (<5%). Male-derived Caco-2 cells were more sensitive to sNPs than female-derived HT-29 cells, suggesting potential sex-based differences. FACS analysis showed 100% cellular uptake in all cancer cells, with TR-146 exhibiting the highest fluorescence intensity. Endocytosis inhibition studies revealed that caveolae-mediated endocytosis played a significant role in sNP uptake, particularly in TR-146 and Caco-2 cells.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate the potential of sNPs as selective and potent anticancer agents, warranting further research to optimize their clinical application.",

The polyphenol and polysaccharide content, along with in vitro antioxidant and anti-tyrosinase properties, were evaluated. The biological effect of E. angustifolia extract was evaluated on the 3T3-L1 cell line. HPLC-DAD analysis confirmed the presence of several polyphenols, particularly caffeic acid derivatives, with echinacoside as the predominant compound, exhibiting strong antioxidant properties. The extract demonstrated no cytotoxic effect on 3T3-L1 cells, and it showed a protective effect by increasing the migration process in an in vitro scratch wound healing test, together with echinacoside and allantoin, which were used as references. Furthermore, the extract reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and promoted that of proteins that accelerate wound closure, such as TGF-\u03b21. The present study demonstrates the potential wound healing properties and the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of E. angustifolia root hydroalcoholic extract, giving a scientific rationale for its traditional use.",

    "content": "The human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) is a high-risk human papillomavirus strain commonly associated with oropharyngeal cancers, including lymph node involvement. The treatment for HPV 16-related tonsil cancer, commonly involving surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, presents significant challenges. Complications such as oral mucositis, xerostomia, dysphagia, dysgeusia, hypogeusia, impaired gustatory function, and significant weight loss frequently arise, leading to reduced nutritional intake, impaired healing, and recovery progression. These challenges underscore the need for supportive interventions to enhance rehabilitation and the post-recovery period, improve treatment tolerance, and maintain quality of life. Objective: This single-subject study examines a 67-year-old male patient diagnosed with a T1N3b (small primary tumor with advanced lump node involvement) associated with HPV 16 positivity, indicating a virus-associated oncogenesis. Methods: The patient underwent radiation therapy and chemotherapy, leading to treatment-associated side effects. After having dietary drinks for daily nourishment, the patient routinely incorporated oral bio extra virgin olive oil (BEVOO) to cope with indicated challenges. Results: Body composition and metabolic parameters showed treatment-induced declines, followed by substantial but not complete recovery during follow-up examination. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores reflected gradual improvements in dysphagia, xerostomia, mucositis, and subtle but ongoing enhancement of the dysgeusia, gustatory perception, and oral palatability. The BEVOO supplementation and mindfulness were associated with positive recovery trends. Additional variables could have impacted the outcomes, preceding and throughout treatment, including the patient\u2019s cognitive and somatic health, environmental conditions, dietary habits, individual attitudes toward recovery, physical activity, and patient way of life. Conclusions: These results emphasize the need for additional research employing a comprehensive, multi-factorial framework that accounts for the complex interplay of physiological, psycho-social, and environmental contributors. More extensive, more diverse studies are essential to confirm these observations and substantiate the role of BEVOO as a supportive intervention in cancer recovery.",

    "content": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a principal contributor to oncological mortality worldwide, with chronic inflammation serving as a fundamental driver of its pathogenesis. Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), a G-protein-coupled receptor, orchestrates inflammation-driven tumorigenesis by potentiating NF-\u03baB and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, thereby fostering epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT), immune evasion, and therapeutic resistance. Despite its pathological significance, targeted modulation of PAR-2 remains an underexplored avenue in CRC therapeutics. Oleocanthal (OC), a phenolic constituent of extra virgin olive oil, is recognized for its potent anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties; however, its regulatory influence on PAR-2 signaling in CRC is yet to be elucidated. This study interrogates the impact of OC on PAR-2-mediated inflammatory cascades using HT-29 and Caco-2 CRC cell lines subjected to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of PAR-2. Expression levels of PAR-2 and TNF-\u03b1 were quantified through Western blotting and RT-PCR, while ELISA assessed TNF-\u03b1 secretion. Intracellular calcium flux, a pivotal modulator of PAR-2-driven oncogenic inflammation, was evaluated via Fluo-4 calcium assays. LPS markedly elevated PAR-2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels in CRC cells (p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA). OC administration (20\u2013150 \u03bcg/mL) elicited a dose-dependent suppression of PAR-2, with maximal inhibition at 100\u2013150 \u03bcg/mL (p < 0.001, Tukey\u2019s post hoc test). Concomitant reductions in TNF-\u03b1 transcription (p < 0.01) and secretion (p < 0.001) were observed, corroborating the anti-inflammatory efficacy of OC. Additionally, OC ameliorated LPS-induced calcium dysregulation, restoring intracellular calcium homeostasis in a concentration-dependent manner (p < 0.01). Crucially, OC exhibited selectivity for PAR-2, leaving PAR-1 expression unaltered (p > 0.05), underscoring its precision as a therapeutic agent. These findings position OC as a selective modulator of PAR-2-driven inflammation in CRC, disrupting the pro-tumorigenic microenvironment through attenuation of TNF-\u03b1 secretion, calcium dysregulation, and oncogenic signaling pathways. This study furnishes mechanistic insights into OC\u2019s potential as a nutraceutical intervention in inflammation-associated CRC. Given the variability in OC bioavailability and content in commercial olive oil, future investigations should delineate optimal dosing strategies and in vivo efficacy to advance its translational potential in CRC therapy.",

    "content": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains among the most aggressive malignancies with limited treatment options, especially in recurrent and metastatic cases. Despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors, survival rates remain suboptimal due to tumor heterogeneity, immune evasion, and treatment resistance. In recent years, Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has revolutionized hematologic cancer treatment by genetically modifying T cells to target tumor-specific antigens like CD19, CD70, BCMA, EGFR, and HER2, leading to high remission rates. Its success is attributed to precise antigen recognition, sustained immune response, and long-term immunological memory, though challenges like cytokine release syndrome and antigen loss remain. Notably, its translation to solid tumors, including HNSCC, faces significant challenges, such as tumor microenvironment (TME)-induced immunosuppression, antigen heterogeneity, and limited CAR T-cell infiltration. To address these barriers, several tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), including EGFR, HER2 (ErbB2), B7-H3, CD44v6, CD70, CD98, and MUC1, have been identified as potential CAR T-cell targets in HNSCC. Moreover, innovative approaches, such as dual-targeted CAR T-cells, armored CARs, and CRISPR-engineered modifications, aim to enhance efficacy and overcome resistance. Notably, combination therapies integrating CAR T-cells with immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade) and TGF-\u03b2-resistant CAR T designs are being explored to improve therapeutic outcomes. This review aimed to elucidate the current landscape of CAR T-cell therapy in HNSCC, by exploring its mechanisms, targeted antigens, challenges, emerging strategies, and future therapeutic potential.",

A novel Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) based on ERAS Society guidelines was designed and implemented. The primary outcome was ERAS compliance. Secondary outcomes included length of stay (LOS) and postoperative complications.MethodsA retrospective study on patients who underwent CRS/HIPEC between 2018 and 2022, with ERAS implementation in 2022. Health records were reviewed. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon tests, Student t\u2010test, and \u03c7\n2 and binomial negative regression. Health Ethics Research Board approval was obtained.ResultsEighty patients underwent CRS/HIPEC: 59 in the pre\u2010ERAS group and 21 in the post\u2010ERAS group. Groups were similar in age, comorbidities, and Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Index. ERAS compliance increased from 32.8% to 70.8% (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Median LOS decreased from 14 to 9 days (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Comparing pre\u2010ERAS to post\u2010ERAS showed no significant difference in the major morbidity rate (13.6% vs. 9.5%) or 30\u2010day readmission (9.4% vs. 4.8%) and no mortalities.

Palmitoyl-DL-carnitine chloride (PC) was used as a protein kinase C inhibitor to provide a cationic surface charge to LARPC. The formulation was characterized for particle size, zeta potential, drug release and various cell culture assays using HUVEC and vemurafenib resistant melanoma cells. The particle size of LARPC was found to be 105.25\u00b12.76 nm with a zeta potential of +26.6\u00b16.25 mV. Inhibition of angiogenesis was demonstrated by ARV and LARPC using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)-based matrigel basement membrane model. Additionally, LARPC demonstrated very low IC50 with promising inhibition of vasculogenic mimicry channel formation, cell migration as well as colony formation in vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cell lines.

This study aims to reveal information on spatial and temporal changes in depression by describing temporal trend differences, regional differences, and gender differences.\nMaterials and Methods: Utilizing data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 (GBD2021) from 1990 to 2021, we outlined the prevalence and burden of depression among 204 countries in 21 regions, including age and sex disparities, and explored the correlation between depressive burden and the sociodemographic index (SDI). The age-standardized rates of prevalence (ASPR), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs, age-standardized DALY rate, ASDR), and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) were employed to evaluate the global burden of depression.\nResults: Our study revealed a greater than 1.8-fold increase in prevalent cases and DALYs for global depressive disorder from 1990 to 2021. Globally, the age-standardized rates (ASRs) slightly declined, with a 1.32% decrease in the ASPR and a 1.84% decrease in the ASDR from 1990 to 2019. The main decline occurred from 2005 to 2010 (4.86% decrease in the ASPR and 6.09% decrease in the ASDR), with the majority of the contributions occurring in the low-middle-SDI and low-SDI regions. The global ASPR and ASDR experienced astonishing jumps from 2019 to 2021, resulting in increases of nearly 11% in the ASPR and 13% in the ASDR. Notably, the ASPR and ASDR of depression decreased in females but increased in males from 1990 to 2019 and reversed thereafter. From 1990 to 2021, among the 21 regions, the EAPCs in most regions were >0, with the only exceptional decline occurring in East Asia in the ASPR \u22120.06 [95% Cl:\u22120.10 to \u22120.03]) and ASDR \u22120.09 [95% Cl:\u22120.13 to \u22120.05]). Compared with those in other regions, the ASPR (0.42 [95% Cl: 0.34\u20130.49]) and ASDR (0.53 [95% Cl: 0.46\u20130.61]) were greater in high-income North America. Among the five SDI regions, the largest increases in ASPR (0.25 [95% Cl: 0.21\u20130.30]) and ASDR (0.31 [95% Cl: 0.26\u20130.37]) occurred in the high-SDI region, with the majority of the contributions occurring from 2019 to 2021. Worldwide, a decreasing trend and significant associations between the ASPR and the SDI (R\u2009=\u2009\u22120.22, p=0.0013) and between the ASDR and the SDI (R\u2009=\u2009\u22120.28, p < 0.001) were observed.\nConclusion: Depression remains a serious challenge worldwide. The trends in depression burden varied across regions and groups. A vibrant socioeconomic environment could have a positive impact on the disease burden. Mental health should be incorporated into public health preparedness and emergency plans in practical ways on the basis of the national conditions of each country.",

Technological advances have prompted a re\u2010evaluation of these chemoanatomical aspects, originally studied in the early years after the discovery of KP and its receptor Kiss1r. Previously, we characterized (Hern\u00e1ndez et al. bioRxiv 2024) seven KP neuronal populations in the mouse brain at the mRNA level, including two novel populations, and examined their response to gonadectomy. In this study, we mapped KP fiber distribution in rats and mice using immunohistochemistry under intact as well as short\u2010 and long\u2010term post\u2010gonadectomy conditions. Kiss1r mRNA expression was examined via RNAscope, in relation to vesicular GABA transporter (Slc32a1) in whole mouse brain, and to KP and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Slc17a6), Kiss1, and Slc32a1 in hypothalamic RP3V and arcuate regions. We identified KP fibers in 118 brain regions, primarily in extra\u2010hypothalamic areas associated with sensorial processing and behavioral state control. KP\u2010immunoreactive fiber density and distribution were largely unchanged by gonadectomy. Kiss1r was expressed prominently in sensorial and state control regions such as the septal nuclei, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, locus coeruleus, hippocampal layers, thalamic nuclei, and cerebellar structures. Co\u2010expression of Kiss1r and Kiss1 was observed in hypothalamic neurons, suggesting both autocrine and paracrine KP signaling mechanisms. These findings enhance our understanding of KP signaling beyond reproductive functions, particularly in sensorial processing and behavioral state regulation.

Discontinuation of psychotropic drugs in the 6\u2010month period prior to suicide and suicide attempts was estimated. Analyses were stratified by drug groups, sex, and age.ResultsAmong 5.8 million Danish citizens(2021), 6374 died by suicide, and 29,332 had a first\u2010ever suicide attempt from 2010 to 2021. Use of psychotropic drugs increased markedly in the 6\u2009months prior to suicide and suicide attempt, e.g., up to 18 incident drug redemptions and 92 prevalent drug redemptions per 100 persons in the month before suicide. The highest rates of both incident and prevalent drug redemptions were observed immediately after the suicide attempt. Psychotropic drug use was generally lower among men. Immediately after the suicide attempt, however, men exhibited a slightly higher level of incident use than women. Ten percent discontinued psychotropic drugs completely in the 6\u2010month period before suicide, while 48% discontinued drugs used in alcohol abuse.ConclusionWe found a marked increase in psychotropic drug use before suicide and before and after attempted suicide.

    "content": "BackgroundParticulate matter less than 2.5 \u00b5m (PM2.5) is a significant air pollutant and is linked to an increased risk of health conditions, including skin diseases. The skin, as the first barrier and the largest organ, is primarily damaged by PM2.5 through different pathways. Several studies have shown that PM2.5 upregulates inflammatory responses through the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and several inflammatory cytokines, leading to PM2.5-induced skin damage. The ROS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Cyclooxygenase-2-Prostaglandin E2 (COX2/PGE2) inflammatory pathways are activated by free radical scavenging and phase II detoxification. Natural products have been suggested as therapeutic agents for mitigating PM2.5-induced skin damage.ObjectivesWe elaborate on the mechanisms of action of natural products and their functions as protectants against environmental skin diseases. This review highlights the optimal doses of natural products for clinical study, which may benefit dermatologists, molecular biologists, clinicians, and healthcare professionals in preventive and alternative medicine.MethodologyThe available scientific literature published between 1999 and 2024 was searched using PubMed and Google Scholar. Multiple keywords related to the topic were used. Only 41 of the screened articles were chosen for this review, as they were the most relevant publications on the topic of the preventive advantages of natural products and specific pathways targeting PM2.5-induced skin injury. All relevant articles meeting the criteria of being original full articles and written in English were included.ResultsThis review summarized the natural products, including phenolic/polyphenolic compounds and flavonoids, that can act as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents by protecting the skin against oxidative stress, inhibiting enzymes that promote free radical formation, enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity, and reducing overall ROS formation. Several natural products have demonstrated efficacy in alleviating intracellular ROS, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy, and apoptosis caused by PM2.5. In addition, phytochemical agents support the restoration of the skin wound healing process and muscle contraction impaired by environmental pollutants, such as PM2.5 and UV rays.ConclusionThis review highlights promising natural agents that can protect against environment-mediated health problems by focusing on their mechanisms of action. Particular emphasis is placed on antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds, including sulforaphane, hesperidin, quercetin, catechin, diphloroethohydroxycarmalol, resveratrol, and ginsenoside, which have become interesting candidates as nutraceuticals due to their potential to reduce reliance on conventional medicines. However, the low stability and bioavailability of natural products remain significant challenges to their clinical use; therefore, further research and development are warranted.",

Sixty male SD rats were divided into control, model, Tiapride (Tia), and JPZDD groups. After the intervention of 28 days, behavioral tests, Nissl staining, Western blot, immunofluorescence, colorimetry, and ELISA were performed to evaluate the pharmacological effects of JPZDD. Proteomics and network pharmacology predicted targets, validated by Western blot.ResultsJPZDD alleviated stereotypic behaviors, hippocampal pathology, and modulated glucose metabolites (GLU, pyruvate, lactate, ATP). It downregulated GLUT1, GLUT3, HK2, and LDHA levels while upregulating PDHA level. Besides, JPZDD balanced M1/M2 microglial phenotypes, reducing IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 and increasing IL-4 and IL-10. UPLC-MS/MS identified 44 active ingredients and 123 targets; proteomics revealed 28 differentially expressed proteins.

    "content": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder marked by sustained hyperglycemia. These disturbances contribute to extensive damage across various tissues and organs, giving rise to severe complications such as vision loss, kidney failure, amputations, and higher morbidity and mortality rates. Furthermore, DM imposes a substantial economic and emotional burden on patients, families, and healthcare systems. Mitophagy, a selective process that targets the clearance of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria, is pivotal for sustaining cellular homeostasis through mitochondrial turnover and recycling. Emerging evidence indicates that dysfunctional mitophagy acts as a key pathogenic driver in the pathogenesis of DM and its associated complications. Natural small molecules are particularly attractive in this regard, offering advantages such as low toxicity, favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, excellent biocompatibility, and a broad range of biochemical activities. This review systematically evaluates the mechanistic roles of natural small molecules\u2014including ginsenosides, resveratrol, and berberine\u2014in enhancing mitophagy and restoring mitochondrial homeostasis via activation of core signaling pathways (e.g., PINK1/Parkin, BNIP3/NIX, and FUNDC1). These pathways collectively ameliorate pathological hallmarks of DM, such as oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the integration of nanotechnology with these compounds optimizes their bioavailability and tissue-specific targeting, thereby establishing a transformative therapeutic platform for DM management. Current evidence demonstrates that mitophagy modulation by natural small molecules not only offers novel therapeutic strategies for DM and its chronic complications but also advances the mechanistic foundation for future drug development targeting metabolic disorders.",

    "content": "The protein alpha-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, including Parkinson\u2019s disease and multiple system atrophy, with growing evidence indicating that lipid dyshomeostasis is a key phenotype in these neurodegenerative disorders. Previously, we identified that \u03b1Syn localizes, at least in part, to mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs), which are transient functional domains containing proteins that regulate lipid metabolism, including the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylserine. In the present study, we analyzed the lipid composition of postmortem human samples, focusing on the substantia nigra pars compacta of Parkinson\u2019s disease and controls, as well as three less affected brain regions of Parkinson\u2019s donors. To further assess synucleinopathy-related lipidome alterations, similar analyses were performed on the striatum of multiple system atrophy cases. Our data reveal region- and disease-specific changes in the levels of lipid species. Specifically, our data revealed alterations in the levels of specific phosphatidylserine species in brain areas most affected in Parkinson\u2019s disease. Some of these alterations, albeit to a lesser degree, are also observed in multiple system atrophy. Using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, we show that \u03b1Syn regulates phosphatidylserine metabolism at MAM domains, and that \u03b1Syn dosage parallels the perturbation in phosphatidylserine levels. These findings support the notion that \u03b1Syn pathophysiology is linked to the dysregulation of lipid homeostasis, which may contribute to the vulnerability of specific brain regions in synucleinopathy. These findings have significant therapeutic implications.",

Previous findings suggest that a dysregulated LM balance, especially within the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway, may contribute to an impaired resolution response and subsequent chronic neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, to date, the local biosynthesis and signaling of LMs within the brain of people with MS (PwMS) remains unexplored. In this study, we, therefore, mapped the distribution of AA and its key downstream LM prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in white matter MS brain tissue and of non-neurological controls (NNCs) for the first time using mass spectrometry imaging. We found that AA levels are lower in MS cases compared to NNCs and reduced in MS lesions compared to peri-lesional tissue. Furthermore, the PGE2/AA ratio, indicating the PGE2 synthesis from the AA substrate, was increased in lesion areas compared to fully myelinated regions in MS. In line with that, the expression of prostaglandin synthesizing enzymes as measured by RT-qPCR was partially increased in MS tissue compared to NNCs. In addition, the expression of prostaglandin E2 receptor 4 (EP4) decreased, while prostaglandin E2 receptor 2 (EP2) showed increased expression levels in MS lesions compared to NNCs and localized specifically to microglia. We also found that PGE2 addition to pro-inflammatory human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia resulted in enhanced cytokine signaling pathways, but also the upregulation of its synthase PTGES and homeostatic/resolving signaling, the latter of which might mainly occur through EP2 signaling. Collectively, our results provide detailed information about the region-specific levels of AA and PGE2 in MS lesions and we propose enhanced PGE2-EP2 signaling in inflamed microglia in MS.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00401-025-02878-3.",

Five types of SB available in the market, including Ca-fortified, high-protein, and low-fat drinks, were analysed. Ca supplementation and high protein content in the beverages significantly enhanced Ca bioaccessibility. The lipid profile demonstrated substantial changes during digestion, due to drastic reductions in saturated fatty acids and marked increases in polyunsaturated fatty acids in the bioaccessible fractions; these changes were mainly related to the content levels of Ca and polyphenols in the beverages. Significant increases in the antioxidant properties, as measured by ABTS and FRAP assays, were noticed after the digestive process. Additionally, ROS generation in Caco-2 cells after induced oxidative damage was prevented by the BF of digested SB. The digested low-fat drink, which also had a low level of protein content, showed the least antioxidant activity.

A LASSO regression model was used to select predictors and the significant factors were used to construct the logistic regression model expression and the nomogram. The prediction model was subjected to100 bootstrap resamples for internal validation to assess its predictive accuracy. Calibration and discrimination were used to assess the performance of the model. A dynamic online nomogram was conducted to make the model easy to use. The clinical use was evaluated by a decision curve analysis.ResultsGender, region of original residence, milk and yogurt intake, puffed foods intake, outdoor activity duration, UV protection index and \u201ctaken calcium or vitamin D supplements within 3 months\u201d were identified as significant predictors of vitamin D deficiency among Chinese college students. The model demonstrated good calibration with a 100 bootstraps analysis. The C-index was 0.677 and the bias-adjusted C-index was 0.668 in internal validation with 100 bootstrap resamples. The decision curve analysis showed a threshold probability between 0.5 and 0.8, using the model added more benefit than considering all patients are deficient or not deficient.ConclusionsThe performance of this vitamin D deficiency prediction model is commendable, and the dynamic online nomogram was proved to be a user-friendly screening tool for identifying high-risk subjects among Chinese college students.

Hypertension, as one of the most common chronic conditions, is frequently observed alongside other chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia. Physical activity is widely acknowledged to be associated with the prevention and management of chronic diseases. However, few studies have examined how different Physical activity behaviors are associated with specific multimorbidity patterns involving hypertension. This study aimed to identify the patterns of association between physical activity status and co-occurring chronic conditions among hypertensive individuals in middle-aged and older adults in South Korea, using association rule analysis.MethodsOur study utilized data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2016\u20132021), involving 21,043 participants aged 45 years and older. A total of 25 chronic diseases were included as related variables for the analysis using association rule mining.ResultsIn the middle-aged and elderly population in South Korea, hypertension has the highest prevalence among all chronic diseases, with a rate of 45%. Our association rule analysis identified a total of nine chronic conditions as antecedents, with diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia being the most frequently observed. Furthermore, a subgroup comparison revealed that the number of association rules identified in the \u2018physically inactive\u2019 group (25 rules) was higher than that in the \u2018physically active\u2019 group (17 rules), and the overall confidence levels in the \u2018inactive\u2019 group were also higher.

A pathogenic relationship has been described between obesity and inflammatory bowel diseases, but Crohn`s disease may be selectively impacted. The role of diet in pathogenesis has also gained significant support in the last few decades. This review explores dietary relationships to account for epidemiological observations.Recent Findings and SummaryQuantifiable indices for diets have been described including a glycemic index, inflammatory indices and levels of food processing. Meta-analyses have been published which examine each for effects on obesity and co-morbidities as well as Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. This review suggests that ultra-processed foods provide the best link between obesity and Crohn\u2019s disease explaining epidemiological observations. However, the other 2 types of dietary indices likely contribute to ulcerative colitis as well as to co-morbidities related to both obesity and inflammatory bowel diseases.The term ultra-processed foods cover a large number of additives and extensive work is needed to define individual or combined harmful effects.

Due to its chronic progressive nature, the predominant clinical signs after a certain point are pain and immobility. The similar pathogenesis allows conclusions to be drawn from canine to human OA. Current treatments are limited and often attempt to treat OA symptoms rather than improve joint structure and function. Collagen hydrolysates as oral supplements are a promising therapeutic option to achieve this advanced therapeutic aim in both species. The effects of oral supplementation were therefore investigated in canine OA patients.MethodIn a systematic, placebo-controlled, double-blind interventional study in 31 dogs with naturally occurring OA, the efficacy of oral supplementation of specific bioactive collagen peptides (BCP) was tested in comparison to the approved combination of the active substances omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E. The dogs were examined on a horizontal treadmill with 4 integrated piezoelectric force plates at the beginning and end of a twelve-week test period. At both points, the owners completed a specific questionnaire containing the validated Canine Brief Pain Inventory (CBPI) and the dogs were fitted with accelerometers to record total daily activity data.ResultsOnly the oral supplementation of BCP resulted in a significant improvement of several kinetic parameters measured using a force-plate fitted treadmill, and the quality of life assessed by CBPI, while accelerometry was unaffected by the intervention.ConclusionThe results of this three-month BCP supplementation study using objective measurement parameters in dogs with naturally occurring OA demonstrate an efficacy, suggesting the therapeutic use of BCP in canine OA patients and demonstrating the relevance of this collagen hydrolysate formulation for the treatment of OA in human patients as well.",

The results show that YTHDF2 is highly expressed after HF induction, and the inhibition of YTHDF2 reduces fibrosis as well as ROS and iron levels.\nIn vitro, overexpression of YTHDF2 increases hepatic stellate cell activation, as well as ROS and iron levels, and this effect is blocked by the silencing of\nACSL4. YTHDF2 acts as a regulator of ACSL4 expression and is involved in m\n6A modification. In addition,\nin vivo experiments indicate that overexpression of ACSL4 reverses the attenuating effect of YTHDF2 interference on HFs. Therefore, YTHDF2 mediates the expression of the ferroptosis marker protein ACSL4 in an m\n6A-dependent manner, thereby affecting HF.",

Research efforts have shown the benefit of proper nutrition in reducing the progression of AD and slowing the condition's progression. Specifically, nutritional intake has been demonstrated to influence neuro-inflammatory pathways. Various diets, including ketogenic, Mediterranean, Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet, and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), have been shown to prevent the onset of AD to different degrees.\u00a0The primary objective of this scoping review was to assess the impacts of various diets on AD onset and progression to identify unmet needs and gaps in understanding. Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, peer-reviewed literature was searched using Boolean operators: \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s\u201d AND \u201cketogenic\u201d OR \u201cDASH diet\u201d OR \u201cMIND diet\u201d OR \u201cMediterranean diet\u201d on EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Web of Science databases. The search was restricted to articles written in English and published in the United States between January 1, 2013, and September 30, 2023. The initial search yielded 121 articles after removing duplicates. After filtering based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 24 articles were selected for further critical appraisal screening. The critical appraisal yielded 12 articles for the analysis included in this scoping review. This review supported the Mediterranean diet as the most effective in improving outcomes among patients with AD. The Mediterranean diet consists of a high intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, olive oil, and unrefined cereals, a moderate intake of fish and wine, and a low intake of dairy products, meat, poultry, and saturated fat. Other diets reviewed, including the DASH and MIND diets, also have promising effects on AD, with less conclusive evidence when compared to the Mediterranean diet. Limitations, including small sample sizes, short durations, and socioeconomic constraints impacting compliance, were noted. This scoping review supports the need for dietary recommendation guidelines for patients with AD.",

    "content": "AbstractSphingolipids are essential components of cell membranes and lipoproteins. They are synthesized de novo in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequently undergo various enzymatic modifications in different organelles, giving rise to a diverse range of biologically active compounds. These molecules play a critical role in regulating cell growth, senescence, migration, apoptosis, and signaling. In recent years, the sphingolipid metabolic pathway has been recognized as a key factor in heart failure (HF) pathophysiology. Abnormal levels of sphingolipid metabolites, such as ceramide (Cer) and sphingomyelin (SM), contribute to oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, ultimately promoting cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Conversely, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) regulate vascular function and influence cardiac remodeling. Additionally, enzymes such as diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) and sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase 1 (SGPL1) modulate cardiac lipid metabolism. Given their role in HF progression, monitoring sphingolipid alterations offers potential as valuable biomarkers for assessing disease severity, prognosis, and diagnosis. Given the complexity of sphingolipid metabolism and its involvement in diverse regulatory biological processes, a comprehensive understanding of its roles at both the cellular and organismal levels in physiopathology remains incomplete. Therefore, this review aims to explore the physiological functions, regulatory mechanisms, and therapeutic potential of sphingolipid metabolism. It will summarize the specific molecular mechanisms driving key pathological processes in HF, including ventricular remodeling, myocardial fibrosis, vascular dysfunction, and metabolic disorders. Finally, the review will highlight targeted sphingolipid metabolites as potential therapeutic strategies, offering new insights into HF diagnosis and treatment, with the goal of advancing adjunctive clinical therapies.",

    "content": "Recent research has shown that Avocado-Soybean Unsaponifiables (ASU) greatly reduce the symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA). It\u2019s yet unknown exactly how ASU works, however, it has been demonstrated to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. These qualities can potentially lessen the need for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) and their secondary effects. This review aims to examine the current literature on ASU, focusing on their efficacy, mechanism of action, and potential utility in treating OA for managing chronic pain associated with this condition. The literature review was conducted manually through Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science (WOS) databases, covering studies from 2000 to 2022 with terms like \u201costeoarthritis,\u201d \u201cOA,\u201d \u201canimal models,\u201d \u201cASU,\u201d and \u201csoy/avocado.\u201d Two reviewers independently screened each article using inclusion and exclusion criteria and categorized the studies into in vitro, preclinical, and clinical groups. According to in vitro research, ASU affect the regulation of molecules related to OA, increasing structural elements like collagen and aggrecan and decreasing pro-inflammatory mediators. Although results vary, pre-clinical research in different animal models has demonstrated positive effects, such as ameliorating histopathological changes and reduced inflammation. Despite some discrepancies regarding structural changes in the joints, clinical trials typically demonstrate symptom relief and slow down the disease progression. While ASU demonstrates significant promise in alleviating OA symptoms and reducing reliance on NSAIDs, further research is essential to fully understand its mechanisms of action. More studies are needed to determine the precise pathways through which ASU exerts its effects and to establish the most effective dosages for its administration, either alone or in combination with other treatments.",

    "content": "BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic was extremely disruptive to clinical practice and research. Given older adults\u2019 increased likelihood of chronic health concerns, limited resources, and greater risk for adverse outcomes of COVID-19, access to research participation during this time was critical, particularly to interventions that may impact health conditions or behaviors. Fortunately, the implementation of personalized, digital research trials during the pandemic allowed for research and intervention delivery for older adults to continue remotely, resulting in feasibility findings that can benefit researchers, practitioners, and the broader older adult population.ObjectiveThis study discusses 3 digital, remote, and personalized intervention trials implemented during the pandemic to increase physical activity (2 trials) or to reduce back pain (1 trial).MethodsWe identified measures used for all 3 trials including Fitbit activity monitor use and self-reported participant satisfaction. Participant levels of Fitbit activity monitor use and satisfaction ratings of the digital trials were compared between younger (younger than 55 years) and older adults (older than 55 years). Differences between these cohorts were analyzed using chi-square tests for categorical outcomes and 2-tailed independent-sample t tests for continuous outcomes.ResultsAcross the 3 trials, the majority of participants reported high satisfaction with the usability of the trials\u2019 digital systems including SMS text message interventions and surveys (\u226562% satisfied) and the use of wearable devices such as Fitbits (\u226581% satisfied). In addition, the use of the Fitbit device was shown to be feasible, as older adults across all trials wore their Fitbits for the majority of the day (mean 20.3, SD 3.6 hours). Furthermore, consistent Fitbit wear was common; 100% of participants older than 55 years wore their Fitbit an average of 10 or more hours per day. These trials highlight that digital, remote intervention delivery may be successfully implemented among older adults by way of personalized trials. Across the 3 digital interventions, feasibility and acceptability were high among older adults, and comparable to younger adults.ConclusionsGiven the success of the current trials amid pandemic restrictions, we argue that these trials serve as a useful framework to aid in designing personalized, digital, remote interventions in other areas of clinical care among older adults and in planning for future disruptions including new pandemics.",

The main medicinal theory for the management of AD belongs to the acetyl-cholinesterase-inhibition pathway and NMDA antagonism. Recent investigation proposed memory improvement by sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors which indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. According to the lack of sufficient evidence about the efficacy of empagliflozin (EMPA) for memory improvement, in comparison with donepezil (DON), the present research was carried out in order to investigate this hypothesis towards scopolamine-induced neurotoxicity on experimental male Wistar rats. The animals divided into two sets, each included 4 groups: The first set of Healthy animals [Control, EMPA (4 or 10\u202fmg/kg), DON (1\u202fmg/kg)]. The second set of rat Alzheimer model, which received 2\u202fmg/kg Scopolamine by intraperitoneal route for 10 days followed by other treatments [AD, AD+\u202fEMPA (4 or 10\u202fmg/kg) and AD+DON].

This task was followed by decapitation of rats in order to evaluate the biochemical oxidative stress parameters in brain tissue. Our data indicated that EMPA significantly improved animals' performance in the behavioral test with a significant decrease in oxidative stress and antioxidant imbalance. In addition, EMPA (4\u202fmg/kg) significantly reduced both cellular malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl content while conversely increased the total reduced glutathione content. Besides, the levels of total as well as endogenous antioxidants in the ferric reducing antioxidant power assay reported to be augmented. It seems that EMPA significantly improved both cellular biochemical aspects and memory performance in animal models in accordance with histopathological assessments.

Obesity-associated metabolic and mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction are key drivers of AD pathology. The hypothalamus is a critical brain region during the development of obesity and dysfunction is an area implicated in the development of AD. NO is an essential mediator of blood flow and mitochondrial bioenergetic function, but the role of NO in obesity-AD is not entirely clear. We investigated diet-induced obesity in female APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP) mouse model of AD, which we treated with two different NO donors (sodium nitrite or L-citrulline). After 26 weeks of a high-fat diet, female APP mice had higher adiposity, insulin resistance, and mitochondrial dysfunction (hypothalamus) than non-transgenic littermate (wild type) controls. Treatment with either sodium nitrite or L-citrulline did not reduce adiposity but improved whole-body energy expenditure, substrate oxidation, and insulin sensitivity. Notably, both NO donors restored hypothalamic mitochondrial respiration in APP mice. Our findings suggest that NO is an essential mediator of whole-body metabolism and hypothalamic mitochondrial function, which are severely impacted by the dual insults of obesity and AD pathology.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-024-75870-8.",

Abdominal LIPUS significantly inhibited the DSS-induced inflammatory response, repaired destroyed crypts, and partially preserved the epithelial barrier. [18F]FEPPA accumulation in the colitis-induced neuroinflammation in the abdomen and specific brain regions significantly decreased after LIPUS treatment. LIPUS maintained intestinal integrity by increasing zonula occludens and occludin levels, reduced lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and lipopolysaccharide levels in the serum, and improved behavioral dysfunctions. Moreover, LIPUS, at an intensity of 0.5\u00a0\u200bW/cm2, reshaped the gut microbiota in colitis-induced mice by increasing the relative abundance of the Firmicutes and decreasing the relative abundance of the Bacteroidota.

However, the pathological mechanisms underlying the development of DCM remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the role and underlying mechanisms of caveolin-1 (CAV1) in DCM.Methods: DCM model was established in vivo through intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin in mice and in vitro through high-glucose (HG) treatment in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs). CAV1-knockout (CAV1-KO) and overexpression (by injecting adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) encoding CAV1) mice were utilized to explore the role of CAV1 in DCM. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-KO and AAV9-NRF2 mice and ML385 (an NRF2 inhibitor) were used to investigate the effect of NRF2 on DCM.Results: CAV1 expression was significantly increased in the cardiac tissues of diabetic mice and HG-treated NRVMs. CAV1 deficiency significantly alleviated diabetes-induced myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, abnormal mitochondria, excessive reactive oxygen species production, and ferroptosis. Conversely, cardiac-specific overexpression of CAV1 exacerbated cardiac dysfunction and myocardial histological abnormalities caused by diabetes. Mechanistically, CAV1 directly bound to NRF2 and inhibited its nuclear translocation, reducing the transcription of glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), accumulating excess peroxide, and inducing ferroptosis and myocardial injury.Conclusion: CAV1 exacerbates the progression of DCM by suppressing the NRF2/GCLC pathway, suggesting that targeting CAV1 is a potential therapeutic approach for DCM.",

Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies addressing adolescent malnutrition in LMIC community settings, involving adolescents aged 10\u201319\u00a0years. A narrative synthesis was employed to analyze and describe the evidence.ResultsOur review included 37 records from 36 studies conducted in 27 countries. Interventions included micronutrient supplementation, nutrition education, food supplementation and fortification, physical activity education, and multicomponent approaches. The intervention duration ranged from 3\u00a0weeks to 2\u00a0years, with limited studies grounded in theoretical frameworks. Fifty-seven percent of interventions (n\u2009=\u200921) targeted adolescent girls, indicating a gap in programs for boys and other vulnerable groups, such as out-of-school adolescents and migrants. The intervention delivery agents included research staff and healthcare professionals. The majority of interventions were delivered in person; few utilized social media strategies.

    "content": "IntroductionDiabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), a cardiac complication of diabetes, is the main cause of the high prevalence of heart failure and associated mortality in diabetic patients. Oxidative stress and lipid metabolism disorder-induced myocardial cell damage are part of the pathogenesis of DCM. In this study, we investigated the effects of alpha-mangostin (A-MG), a natural antioxidant extracted from mangosteen peel, on in vitro and in vivo DCM models.MethodsH9C2 rat cardiomyocytes were treated with high glucose (HG) and palmitic acid (PA) for 24\u00a0h to establish an in vitro DCM cell model. Cell viability and cytotoxicity were evaluated after treatment with varying concentrations of A-MG (0.3, 1, 3, 9, or 27\u00a0\u03bcM) using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. Flow cytometry assessment was used to detect apoptosis. Molecular mechanisms were investigated through transcriptome analysis, quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and Western blotting. Type 2 diabetic (T2D) mice, induced by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) combined with low-dose streptozotocin (STZ), received either vehicle, low-dose A-MG (100\u00a0mg/kg/d), or high-dose A-MG (200\u00a0mg/kg/d) for 6\u00a0weeks. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography. H&E and Masson\u2019s staining were used to evaluate cardiac tissue structure and fibrosis, and Western blotting was used to evaluate myocardial protein expression.ResultsIn HG/F-induced H9C2 cells, A-MG (1 and 3\u00a0\u03bcM) significantly increased cell viability (p < 0.01) and reduced LDH release (p < 0.05). A-MG (3\u00a0\u03bcM) attenuated lipid accumulation (p < 0.05), normalized mitochondrial membrane potential (p < 0.01), and inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (p < 0.05), malondialdehyde (MDA) production (p < 0.01), and apoptosis (p < 0.05). A-MG also inhibited the nuclear translocation of Forkhead box class O1 (FOXO1) (p < 0.05); reduced the expression of CD36 (p < 0.05), PPAR\u03b1 (p < 0.01), and CPT1\u03b2 (p < 0.05) proteins; enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (p < 0.05); and upregulated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (p < 0.01), HO-1 (p < 0.05), and SOD2 (p < 0.05) protein expression levels. Further investigation in HG/F-induced H9C2 cells indicated that A-MG inhibits the uptake of fatty acids (FAs) by regulating the AKT/FOXO1/CD36 signaling pathway, reduces excessive \u03b2-oxidation of FAs mediated by PPAR\u03b1/CPT1\u03b2 through the inhibition of FOXO1 nuclear translocation, and stimulates the AKT/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway to increase the cellular antioxidant capacity. In diabetic mice, low-dose A-MG treatment increased anti-oxidative stress capacity, decreased myocardial lipid accumulation, reduced fibrosis and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and improved left ventricular contractile function.ConclusionUsing both in vitro and in vivo DCM models, our study demonstrates that A-MG reduces lipid accumulation and excessive mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation while enhancing antioxidant capacity. These results suggest that A-MG may be a novel therapeutic option for DCM.",

    "content": "PurposeSubretinal fibrosis (SRF) represents a significant contributor to irreversible vision loss in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). This study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of SRF and identify potential therapeutic targets.MethodsThe SRF model was established using a two-stage laser-induced protocol in C57BL/6J mice. RNA-seq analysis was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 10 days and 30 days post-second laser. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to validate the expression levels of selected DEGs including zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (AZGP1). Recombinant AZGP1 (rAZGP1) was intravitreally administrated to investigate its effects on SRF. The ARPE-19 cells were used to demonstrate the role of AZGP1 in modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).ResultsRNA-seq of RPE/choroid complex identified a total of 66 DEGs between samples collected at 10 days and 30 days post-second laser compared with controls (log2(fold change) \u2265 1, false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05), with Azgp1 being one of the most significant downregulated genes. Intravitreal injection of rAZGP1 markedly reduced collagen I and CD31 positive areas in RPE/choroid flat-mounts. Co-localization of AZGP1 and RPE65 was observed in patients with nAMD (GSE135922) and SRF mouse models. Treatment with rAZGP1 resulted in significantly lower expressions of collagen I, \u03b1-SMA, and fibronectin in ARPE-19 cells after TGF\u03b21 induction. Both knockdown and overexpression studies demonstrated that AZGP1 regulated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway within ARPE-19 cells.ConclusionsThe abnormal expression pattern of AZGP1 is critical for the development of SRF. Exogenous supplementation with AZGP1 may represent a promising strategy for ameliorating SRF by inhibiting EMT within RPE through the PI3K/AKT pathway.",

    "content": "Background/Objectives: Recent research has established that metabolic factors may increase the vulnerability to develop anorexia nervosa (AN). The aim of this study was to explore the serum concentrations of leptin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), insulin and insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) as possible state or trait biomarkers for AN in the acute and recovery (recAN) phases. Our secondary aim was to test associations between the tested markers and demographic and clinical characteristics. Methods: This cross-sectional study included data from 56 participants with AN, 24 recAN participants and 51 healthy controls (HCs). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to quantify serum concentrations of leptin, IGF-1, insulin and IRS-1. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and linear regression models were utilised to test our results. Results: There were significant differences with a large effect size between the groups for serum leptin (p < 0.001; d = 0.80), whereby people with AN had lower leptin than those with recAN (p = 0.023; d = 0.35) and HCs (p < 0.001; d = 0.74). The between-group comparison of IGF-1 did not reach significance, although the effect size was moderate (d = 0.6) and was driven by lower levels of IGF-1 in people with acute AN compared to HCs (p = 0.036; d = 0.53). Serum insulin and IRS-1 did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Low leptin levels seen in individuals with AN may be due to starvation leading to fatty tissue depletion. Understanding the regulation of IGF-1 and insulin signalling over the course of the disorder requires further investigation.",

    "content": "Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), mainly produced by gut microbiota through the fermentation process of dietary fibers and proteins, are crucial to human health, with butyrate, a famous four-carbon SCFA, standing out for its inevitably regulatory impact on both gut and immune functions. Within this narrative review, the vital physiological functions of SCFAs were examined, with emphasis on butyrate\u2019s role as an energy source for colonocytes and its ability to enhance the gut barrier while exhibiting anti-inflammatory effects. Knowledge of butyrate synthesis, primarily generated by Firmicutes bacteria, can be influenced by diets with specifically high contents of resistant starches and fiber. Butyrate can inhibit histone deacetylase, modulate gene expression, influence immune functionality, and regulate tight junction integrity, supporting the idea of its role in gut barrier preservation. Butyrate possesses systemic anti-inflammatory properties, particularly, its capacity to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines and maintain immune homeostasis, highlighting its therapeutic potential in managing dysbiosis and inflammatory diseases. Although butyrate absorption into circulation is typically minimal, its broader health implications are substantial, especially regarding obesity and type 2 diabetes through its influence on metabolic regulation and inflammation. Furthermore, this narrative review thoroughly examines butyrate\u2019s growing recognition as a modulator of neurological health via its interaction with the gut\u2013brain axis. Additionally, butyrate\u2019s neuroprotective effects are mediated through activation of specific G-protein-coupled receptors, such as FFAR3 and GPR109a, and inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Research indicates that butyrate can alleviate neurological disorders, including Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, autism spectrum disorder, and Huntington\u2019s disease, by reducing neuroinflammation, enhancing neurotransmitter modulation, and improving histone acetylation. This focus will help unlock its full therapeutic potential for metabolic and neurological health, rather than exclusively on its well-known benefits for gut health, as these are often interconnected.",

    "content": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term systemic autoimmune disorder that causes joint inflammation, swelling, pain, bone erosion, and deformities. Recent findings emphasize the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of bioactive natural compounds, such as polyphenols extracted from plants and fruits, and their possible synergistic effect when used in combination with current therapies to improve the prognosis and symptoms of inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Here, we report that Sicilian extra virgin olive oil polyphenol-enriched extracts (PE-EVOOs) reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1 \u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from both RA patients and healthy subjects (HSs) treated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) as a control. HPLC-ESI-MS analysis highlighted that PE-EVOOs are rich in different polyphenolic compounds responsible for many of the observed biological effects. At molecular levels, Western blotting analyses revealed that PE-EVOO treatment is associated with the downregulation of the phosphorylated and active form of the inflammatory transcription factor NF-\u03baB and the pro-inflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2). In addition, PE-EVOOs upregulated the transcription factor Nrf2 and its target antioxidant enzyme catalase and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Collectively, these results suggest a possible use of PE-EVOOs as potential adjuvants for the treatment of RA.",

Subsequently, network pharmacology and molecular docking were performed to screen out the potential signaling pathway. ELISA, PCR and wb were used to evaluate the effect of JQP on AS-FLS activity and inflammatory factors. The role of NONHSAT227927.1/JAK2/STAT3 combination in inflammation was studied by editing NONHSAT227927.1 and adding the JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor AG490. Involvement of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway was detected by PCR, WB, or immunofluorescence analysis.ResultsRetrospective data mining results show that JQP can effectively reduce the immune inflammatory response in AS patients. Through network pharmacology and molecular docking, it is speculated that JQP exerts its effect on AS through the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Overexpression of NONHSAT227927.1 activated the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and promoted the expression of inflammatory factors, while serum containing JQP reversed the effects of NONHSAT227927.1 overexpression. NONHSAT227927.1 silencing inhibits the proliferation of AS-FLSs, inhibits the levels of inflammatory factors, and reduces the expression of JAK2/STAT3 protein. After adding the pathway blocker AG490, it was observed that the cell viability of AS-FLSs was reduced by inflammatory factors and the levels of JAK2/STAT3 were inhibited. , and overexpression of NONHSAT227927.1 can reverse this trend.ConclusionsJQP exerted an anti-inflammatory effect on AS by inhibiting the NONHSAT227927.1/JAK2/STAT3 axis.",

This study aimed to assess GA\u2019s renoprotective effects in a model of diabetic nephropathy mediated by low dose streptozotocin (STZ) combined with a high-fat diet, focusing on its potential to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. Control-treated vehicle and STZ/high-fat diet-mediated diabetic rats were administered either the vehicle or 3 or 6 mg/kg of GA to assess its effects on renal inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress. Renal histological changes were assessed, and markers for inflammation and oxidative stress, including I-\u03baB\u03b1, p-p38/MAPK, and p-p65NF-\u03baB pathways, were measured to explore the mechanisms of GA. Diabetic rats showed significant renal dysfunction, structural damage, and increased inflammation and fibrosis. Treatment with GA markedly improved renal structure and function. GA also reduced oxidative stress, increased I-\u03baB\u03b1 expression, and inhibited key signaling pathways, specifically p-p38/MAPK and p-p65NF-\u03baB, involved in cellular inflammation.

We sought to define the cellular and temporal dynamics of the synovial immune niche in a mouse model of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA), and to identify stromal-immune crosstalk mechanisms that coordinate macrophage function and phenotype. We induced PTOA in mice using a non-invasive tibial compression model of anterior cruciate ligament rupture (ACLR). Single-cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry were used to assess immune cell populations in healthy (Sham) and injured (7 and 28 days post-ACLR) synovium. Characterization of synovial macrophage polarization states was performed, alongside computational modeling of macrophage differentiation, as well as implicated transcriptional regulators and stromal-immune communication axes. Immune cell types are broadly represented in healthy synovium, but experience drastic expansion and speciation in PTOA, most notably in the macrophage portion. We identified several polarization states of macrophages in synovium following joint injury, underpinned by distinct transcriptomic signatures, and regulated in part by stromal-derived macrophage colony-stimulating factor signaling. The transcription factors Pu.1, Cebp\u03b1, Cebp\u03b2, and Jun were predicted to control differentiation of systemically derived monocytes into pro-inflammatory synovial macrophages. In summary, we defined different synovial macrophage subpopulations present in healthy and injured mouse synovium. Nuanced characterization of the distinct functions, origins, and disease kinetics of macrophage subtypes in PTOA will be critical for targeting these highly versatile cells for therapeutic purposes.",

    "content": "AbstractOsteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease influenced by multiple factors, with its etiology arising from intricate interactions among mechanical stress, inflammatory processes, and disruptions in bone metabolism. Recent research in bone immunology indicates that immune-mediated mechanisms significantly contribute to the progression of OA, highlighting the interactions among immune cells, cytokine networks, and bone components. Immune cells interact with osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes in a variety of ways. These interactions foster a pro-inflammatory microenvironment, contributing to cartilage breakdown, synovial inflammation, and the sclerosis of subchondral bone. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of bone immunology in OA, focusing on the critical role of immune cells and their cytokine-mediated feedback loops in the pathophysiology of OA. In addition, we are exploring novel therapeutic strategies targeting bone immune pathways, including macrophage polarization, T-cell differentiation, and stem cell therapy to restore the metabolic balance between immunity and bone. By integrating cutting-edge research in bone immunology, this review integrates the latest advancements in bone immunology to construct a comprehensive framework for unraveling the pathogenesis of OA, laying a theoretical foundation for the development of innovative precision therapies.",

Further revealing the microbiota and related metabolic disorders in the preclinical stage of RA (pre-RA) is of great significance for exploration of disease mechanisms.MethodsDBA/1 mice were injected with type II collagen on days 0 and 21 to establish collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. Footpad thickness, serum autoantibodies, and joint histopathology were used to assess the progression of RA. A combination of 16S rRNA sequencing, untargeted metabolomics and targeted short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) analysis were employed to comprehensively investigate the alterations of gut microbiota and fecal metabolites in CIA during the pre-RA stage.Results20 days after the initial collagen immunization, CIA mice showed immune responses without joint symptoms, alongside gut microbiota disruption. Alterations were observed in 20 microbial taxa, including Oscillospira, Bifidobacterium, Ruminococcus, Allobaculum, Alistipes, Lactobacillus, and Candidatus_Arthromitus, etc. Untargeted and targeted metabolomics identified 33 altered fecal metabolites, mainly including sugars and their derivatives, amino acids, long-chain fatty acids and SCFAs, etc. Correlation analysis showed significant correlations between specific gut microbial abundances and fecal metabolite levels. Especially, SCFAs were strongly associated with Bifidobacterium, Alistipes, Ruminococcus, Anaerotruncus, and Allobaculum.ConclusionThese findings suggest that collagen immunization leads to disruption of gut microbiome and induces changes of fecal metabolites in mice, which may play a key role in early development of RA in CIA mice.",

The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) plays a crucial role in maintaining retinal homeostasis; however, its dysfunction\u2014linked to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation\u2014contributes to the progression of degenerative diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This review highlights the therapeutic potential of HHC in protecting and regenerating RPE cells. It explores the effects of oxidative stress on the RPE, the mechanisms underlying its damage, and the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory mediators. HHC has demonstrated the ability to modulate these pathways by activating nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), enhancing antioxidant defenses, and inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Preclinical studies suggest that HHC mitigates vascular remodeling and endothelial dysfunction by reducing the expression of transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b21) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Moreover, HHC improves nitric oxide bioavailability and promotes nitric oxide synthase expression, thereby counteracting oxidative stress-induced vascular damage. Emerging evidence indicates that HHC may be a promising candidate for the treatment of retinal degenerative diseases, particularly those associated with oxidative stress and inflammation.

Based on these considerations, we conducted a parallel study combining the genetic analysis (SSRs marker) and chemical profiling (polyphenols and antioxidant capacity) of fig leaves to characterize 15 cultivars of the Tuscany region. A genetic analysis performed using seven SSR oligonucleotide primers successfully allowed the discrimination of the cultivars studied, with primers MFC2, MFC3, and LMFC30 exhibiting the highest polymorphism. The phytochemical profiling of the leaves, conducted by HPLC-DAD-TOF-MS, revealed 17 phenolic compounds, among which caffeic acid derivatives were the most abundant. The psolaren compound was absent only in Gigante di Carmignano cv. The antiradical capacity varied among cultivars, with Perticone, Brogiotto Nero, and Paradiso exhibiting the highest antiradical capacity.

    "content": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognized not only for its acute effects but also for its ability to cause LongCOVID Syndrome (LCS), a condition characterized by persistent symptoms affecting multiple organ systems. This review examines the molecular and immunological mechanisms underlying LCS, with a particular focus on autophagy inhibition, chronic inflammation, oxidative, nitrosative and calcium stress, viral persistence and autoimmunology. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms involved in LCS include (1) autoimmune activation, (2) latent viral persistence, where SARS-CoV-2 continues to influence host metabolism, (3) reactivation of latent pathogens such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV), exacerbating immune and metabolic dysregulation, and (4) possible persistent metabolic and inflammatory dysregulation, where the body fails to restore post-infection homeostasis. The manipulation of cellular pathways by SARS-CoV-2 proteins is a critical aspect of the virus\u2019 ability to evade immune clearance and establish long-term dysfunction. Viral proteins such as NSP13, ORF3a and ORF8 have been shown to disrupt autophagy, thereby impairing viral clearance and promoting immune evasion. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction, dysregulated calcium signaling, oxidative stress, chronic HIF-1\u03b1 activation and Nrf2 inhibition create a self-sustaining inflammatory feedback loop that contributes to tissue damage and persistent symptoms. Therefore understanding the molecular basis of LCS is critical for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Targeting autophagy and Nrf2 activation, glycolysis inhibition, and restoration calcium homeostasis may provide novel strategies to mitigate the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future research should focus on personalized therapeutic interventions based on the dominant molecular perturbations in individual patients.",

    "content": "IntroductionThe hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio (HRR) is acknowledged as a promising new prognostic biomarker. Nevertheless, investigations into its connection with cognitive function have yielded unclear results.AimThis study aimed to investigate the association between the hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio (HRR) and cognitive function in older adults in the United States.MethodsThis study utilized data obtained from the NHANES database, encompassing the years 2011 to 2014. The participant cohort consisted of elderly individuals aged 60\u202fyears and older, all of whom underwent thorough assessments of cognitive function, hemoglobin levels, and red blood cell width. We employed weighted logistic regression analysis, along with restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves and subgroup analyses, to rigorously evaluate the association between hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio (HRR) and cognitive function.ResultsThis study encompassed a total of 2,520 participants, with a mean age of 69.44\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.76\u202fyears. After adjusting for multiple covariates, logistic regression analysis indicated a significant linear cognitive impairment between HRR and cognitive function. Specifically, each one-unit increase in HRR was associated with an 82% reduction in the probability of cognitive impairment among participants (OR\u202f=\u202f0.18, 95% CI: 0.04\u20130.78). This relationship remained exist after HRR was categorized into tertiles. Participants in the highest HRR tertile exhibited a 42% lower likelihood of cognitive impairment compared to those in the lowest tertile (OR\u202f=\u202f0.58; 95% CI: 0.37\u20130.91, p\u202f=\u202f0.022). To validate the robustness of our findings, we conducted subgroup analyses, which consistently demonstrated stable results across all evaluated groups.ConclusionThis cross-sectional study revealed a significant negative correlation between HRR and cognitive function.",

    "content": "This study investigates the potential reuse of Prunus spinosa (blackthorn) seeds, a food industry by-product. Traditionally discarded, these seeds are now being explored for their bioactive compounds. In this work, seeds were used as raw material for supercritical CO2 extraction. Two distinct extracts were obtained at low and high pressure (SFE90 and SFE200) and both extracts presented an aqueous phase (WE90 and WE200). SFE90 analysis by GC/MS allowed us to identify benzaldehyde and fatty acids (mainly oleic and linoleic acids). The fatty acid profile of SFE200, determined by HPLC-DAD/ELSD, showed that oleic and linoleic acids were predominant in supercritical oil. The phytochemical composition of the water extracts, analyzed via LC-DAD-ESI-MS, revealed that higher pressure enhanced the recovery of specific flavonols and anthocyanins, while lower pressure preserved various polyphenolic subclasses. WE90 was rich in 3-feruloylquinic acid and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside, whereas WE200 was rich in caffeic acid hexoside 2 and dihydro-o-coumaric acid glucoside. Benzaldehyde was individuated in WE90 and WE200 by HPLC-DAD analysis. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that WE90, WE200 and SFE200 had anticancer effects on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, while all extracts did not remarkably affect the viability and morphology of human skin keratinocytes (HaCaT cells). These results suggest that P. spinosa seed extracts have potential nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications.",

    "content": "BackgroundDespite growing emphasis on plant-based eating, animal protein consumption remains high among Americans. The biological effects of different dietary protein sources within healthy plant-forward whole-diet patterns are poorly understood, and controlled-feeding methodologies for examining potential impacts are underreported.ObjectivesThis methods-report describes feasible approaches for menu planning and protein quality assessment within a 2-arm crossover randomized controlled feeding trial over 18 wk among rural Midwestern older adults. The primary trial aims to evaluate the effect of 2 protein-distinct diets on age-related health risk factors. The objectives of this methods-report are to 1) describe the development of preportioned, ready-to-eat, macronutrient-matched, low ultra-processed, plant-forward, protein-distinct menus aligned with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans for home consumption, and 2) present evidence-based strategies addressing the unique challenges posed by an all-food-provided, protein-distinct intervention.MethodsParticipants completed 2 8-wk feeding phases separated by a 2-wk washout; one arm consisting of 162 g/d of lean pork (meat-protein source) and the other an equivalent amount of protein from pulses (plant-protein source). These primary proteins contributed \u226545% of protein intake within a 2000 kcal/d cyclic menu. Data quality, adherence, and participant experience were assessed using descriptive and inferential statistics.ResultsMacronutrient distributions of the overall diets were closely matched despite differences in primary protein densities (meat-protein source 261.7 mg/g; plant-protein source 120.6 mg/g). Both diets featured increased fiber but reduced total and saturated fats, sodium, and ultra-processed foods compared to baseline. Consumed energy, though lower than provided, was matched between the intervention arms.ConclusionsInterventions were well-received, reflecting strong participant interest in healthier eating. Results illustrate a practical, scalable method for evaluating specific protein sources within a plant-forward diet, informing future studies and consumer practices.The trials were registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT05577858 and NCT05581953.",

    "content": "IntroductionCoccidiosis is a protozoan disease caused by Eimeria species, which multiply in the intestinal tract and lead to severe inflammatory responses. While coccidiostats are available for control, resistance to these treatments has been confirmed, underscoring the need for new eco-friendly approaches. In recent years, natural plant sources have gained attention as effective alternatives for treating various parasitic diseases. Krameria lappacea has been used in traditional medicine due to its pharmacological properties. This study examined the effects of the aqueous methanolic extract of K. lappacea roots (KLRE) on jejunal inflammation and immune response in a murine model infected with Eimeria papillata.MethodsTwenty-five male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into five groups. The first group received only distilled water, while the second group was administered 200 mg/kg of KLRE for 5 days. The third, fourth, and fifth groups were orally injected with 103 sporulated oocysts of the Eimeria parasite. For treatment, the fourth group received KLRE (200 mg/kg), and the fifth group received amprolium (120 mg/kg) orally for 5 days. All mice were euthanized on day 5 post-infection (p.i.), and blood samples and jejunum were collected. Investigations were conducted to assess oocyst shedding, cellular immune response, and the histological changes in the jejunum of the mice. Levels of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Additionally, the mRNA expression of CXC motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), interferon-inducible gene 202b (IFi202b), and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP-1) was analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).ResultsOur study demonstrated that mice infected with E. papillata produced an average of 5.387 \u00d7 106 \u00b1 4.29 \u00d7 105 oocysts per gram of feces by day 5 post-infection. In contrast, the output was significantly reduced to 1.308 \u00d7 106 \u00b1 1.36 \u00d7 105 oocysts per gram of feces in mice treated with KLRE. These findings suggest that the host immune response to the intracellular Eimeria parasite triggers inflammation and injury in the jejunum of the mice. This was evidenced by several factors: (i) an elevated inflammatory histological score, (ii) an increased cellular immune response characterized by neutrophils and lymphocytes, (iii) elevated protein levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, measured at approximately 13.67 \u00b1 2.07, 78.98 \u00b1 4.17, and 222.28 \u00b1 10.18 pg/ml, respectively, and (iv) upregulated expression of the mRNA genes CXCL10, IFi202b, and SPP-1, which showed fold changes of approximately 2.83, 3.55, and 3.07-fold, respectively. Our study found that all parameters associated with the infection were significantly altered during treatment with KLRE.ConclusionOur data showed that KLRE treatment significantly reduced inflammation and histological damage in the jejunum caused by E. papillata infections.",

When associated with cancer, it correlates with poorer clinical outcomes. Cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, prevalent globally and in Brazil, are associated with a greater nutritional risk. Early detection and intervention for nutritional risks are critical in this population. Recent studies on turmeric/curcumin have demonstrated beneficial effects in cancer patients. Specifically, curcumin have shown promise in reducing muscle depletion, oxidative stress, and improving strength and fatigue, factors related to sarcopenia. This review aims to elucidate sarcopenia and sarcopenia secondary to cancer, emphasizing nutritional management and the role of curcumin supplementation. Effective cancer management, whether with or without sarcopenia, demands comprehensive public health strategies and multimodal interventions within healthcare institutions. Nutrition is pivotal across the cancer care journey, encompassing screening, guidance, and provision of nutrients that support maintaining or recovering body composition. Curcumin supplementation emerges as a potential adjuvant to the standard cancer treatment and sarcopenia management. Nevertheless, further clinical studies are warranted to substantiate these findings.",

Gut microbiota and plasma metabolites have been implicated in FM, but their causal relationships remain unexplored. This study aims to assess the causal relationships between gut microbiota, plasma metabolites, and FM using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis and to explore potential mediating mechanisms. Public genome-wide association study data were analyzed using bidirectional MR. Associations between gut microbiota, plasma metabolites, and FM were evaluated, and multivariable MR identified mediating metabolites. Results were validated with inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger, and weighted median methods, with metabolic pathway enrichment analysis for further insights. MR identified protective associations between FM and four taxa (family Enterobacteriaceae, genus Butyricicoccus, genus Coprococcus1, and order Enterobacteriales) and risk associations with genus Eggerthella and genus Ruminococcaceae UCG005. Additionally, 82 plasma metabolites linked to pathways such as caffeine metabolism, \u03b1-linolenic acid metabolism, GLP-1, and incretin regulation were associated with FM. Mediation analysis revealed Enterobacteriaceae and Enterobacteriales influenced FM risk through 2,3-dihydroxypyridine and palmitoylcholine. Personalized dietary interventions, such as limiting caffeine intake, increasing omega-3 fatty acid consumption, adopting a low glycemic index diet, and reducing the intake of high-oxalate foods, may effectively alleviate FM-related symptoms by modulating metabolic pathways, reducing inflammation, and mitigating oxidative stress. This study highlights the intricate interactions between the gut microbiota and metabolic pathways, providing critical scientific evidence and actionable targets for clinical interventions, dietary management, and precision medicine approaches in FM treatment.",

    "content": "Heat stress (HS), driven by rising global temperatures, significantly impairs the nutritional composition and sensory quality of meat from monogastric animals, particularly swine and poultry. HS induces physiological disturbances, including reduced feed intake, oxidative stress, and endocrine disruption, which together reduce muscle protein content by 10\u201315% and essential amino acid levels (e.g., lysine, methionine, threonine) by 15\u201325%. Lipid profiles are also altered, with up to 30% reductions in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially omega-3s, and an increased saturated fat content. Additionally, HS reduces the retention of vitamins E, A, D, and C by 20\u201350% and critical minerals such as selenium, zinc, and iron, compromising antioxidant capacity, immune function, and oxygen transport. These changes diminish meat tenderness, juiciness, flavour, and colour stability, leading to reduced consumer appeal and dietary quality. The consumption of heat-stressed meat may elevate risks for cardiovascular disease, oxidative stress, and micronutrient deficiencies. Mitigation strategies, including dietary antioxidant and osmolyte supplementation, genetic selection for thermotolerance, and optimised feeding practices, can reduce oxidative damage by up to 40% and improve nutrient retention. This review synthesises the current evidence on HS-induced meat quality deterioration and explores nutritional and management strategies to protect animal productivity and human health.",

    "content": "It is now known that diet or food is one of the environmental factors that can induce or contribute to autoimmunity. In a healthy person with a normal functioning immune system, food substances encounter no resistance and are allowed passage through the immune barriers without triggering immune reactivity. However, clinicians are becoming increasingly aware that modern food-processing methods can increase or decrease the immune reactivity of foods, including allergic reactions. Immune reactions to undigested food antigens could result in the production of IgE antibodies, which are involved in immediate immune reactivity, and in IgG and IgA antibodies, which are involved in delayed immune reactivity. Currently, measurements of these antibodies are generally only performed against antigens derived from raw foods. However, testing for food reactivity based only on raw food consumption is inaccurate because people eat both raw and cooked foods. Even home-cooked foods undergo different kinds of preparation or processing. Food processing can change the structure of raw food materials into secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures that can have different reactive properties. This can affect the body\u2019s normal oral tolerance of food, causing the immune system to mistakenly identify food as a harmful foreign substance and react to it immunologically, leading to food immune reactivity. This abnormal reaction to food molecules can lead to the production of antibodies against not just target food antigens but also the body\u2019s own tissues, which can have significant implications in autoimmunity induction due to cross-reactivity and the other mechanisms discussed here. We hope that this present review will stimulate further research on the role of modified food antigens in the induction of autoimmunity based on some or all of the key points discussed in this review.",

Details regarding their diet, sea-food consumption, habits, comorbidities, daily activity (using GPAQ questionnaire), and blood reports were collected. ASCVD risk score was calculated using an online ASCVD risk estimator. Blood samples of 96 patients (cases 40, controls 56) was tested for cholesterol esterase transfer protein (CETP) levels using ELISA, and the results were compared.ResultsPatients with high HDL cholesterol were found to be physically more active and had median metabolic equivalent (METs) of 4680 (1200, 8580) compared with controls with median METs of 1680 (720, 5580), P-0.013.

However, underlying risk factors for these associations have not previously been explored. Using a life course framework, the present study explores how early childhood emotional and behavioral dysregulation and PI may be associated with progressive cardiometabolic risk factors in adolescence and young adulthood among male and female respondents in an Australian birth cohort.MethodsThe study follows a subset of 7,223 live, singleton births from 1981 to 1984 in Brisbane, Australia where data was collected on parental imprisonment at ages 5 & 14 and behaviors from the Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) at age 5. Our sample examines 1,884 males and 1,758 females whose mothers completed prenatal, age 5, and age 14 interviews and respondents completed one or more interviews at a health clinic at ages 14, 21, and 30. Multivariate regression was used to examine cross-sectional results, while individual growth models examined longitudinal patterns.ResultsDividing the analysis by sex, we examined how parental imprisonment was potentially mediated or moderated by CBCL subscale measures for aggression, social-attention-thought (SAT) disorders, internalizing, and depression. No associations were found among male respondents. Among female respondents, controlling for these behaviors, there was a significant association between parental imprisonment and higher systolic blood pressure at age 30, while all CBCL measures were found to moderate waist circumference at age 30 and BMI at ages 14, 21, and/or 30. Using individual growth curve modelling, we observed the increased CBCL aggression and SAT scores were increasingly associated with higher BMI as respondents aged in adulthood.ConclusionsUsing prospective cohort data, our results suggest that PI and emotional and behavioral dysregulation are associated with BMI, systolic blood pressure, and waist circumference in females, along with potentially increasing levels of cardiometabolic risk, as measured by increased BMI, from age 14 through age 30. The result is suggestive of the importance of examining early emotional/behavioral problems and PI as joint risk factors for developing cardiometabolic risk factors that may progress into cardiometabolic diseases at later stages in the life course.",

Understanding the trends and disparities in the burden of HF caused by CKD can provide valuable insights into health policymaking.MethodsThis study was a secondary analysis based on previously published data. We obtained global, regional, national, and age- and sex-specific data on the prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) of HF caused by CKD from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 (GBD 2021) and performed a secondary comparative analysis by age, sex, time, location, sociodemographic index (SDI), and health system level.ResultsIn 2021, there were 1,936.9 (95%UI: 1,600.2\u20132,343.5) thousand cases of HF caused by CKD globally, with an age-standardized rate of YLDs of 3.1 (95%UI: 1.9\u20134.4) per 100,000 population. The global burden of HF caused by CKD has continuously increased from 1990 to 2021 and is expected to keep growing through 2045 according to predictions.

Laboratory tests including blood lipid, FA, and homocysteine (Hcy) levels, and pathological evaluation of the atherosclerosis lesion area and thickness were performed. Hepatic and jejunal gene expressions related to lipid and folate metabolism pathways including 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR) were monitored using RT-PCR.ResultsThe HFHCD+MTX group showed increased blood Hcy (p<0.01) and decreased FA levels (p<0.05) in accordance with increased hepatic MTR mRNA expression (p<0.1) and exacerbation of atherosclerosis (p=0.051 for lesion area and p=0.045 for lesion thickness) compared to the HFHCD group.

    "content": "Background: Obesity is associated with the altered gustatory perception of dietary fatty acids. Celastrol, a triterpene, has been demonstrated to exert anti-obesity effects in rodents. We assessed the role of Celastrol in the modulation of the oro-sensory perception of lipids in control and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Methods: Male mice of the C57B/6J strain were fed a HFD for 11 weeks and then were administered or not with Celastrol further for 4 weeks. The body weight was recorded weekly. Before the sacrifice, the animals were subjected to oro-sensory detection of a dietary long-chain fatty acid in a two-bottle choice paradigm. After the sacrifice, the fungiform taste buds were isolated and analyzed for mRNA expression, encoding fat sensors (CD36 and GPR120) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1). Circulating concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were also determined, and liver was used to analyze the mRNA expression of lipogenic genes. Results: Celastrol administration in obese mice decreased body weight and also re-established the loss of oro-sensory perception for a dietary fatty acid, and this phenomenon was, in part, due to the upregulation of mRNA, encoding fat taste receptors (CD36 and GPR120) in tongue taste bud cells. Furthermore, Celastrol decreased inflammation both in taste buds and blood circulation. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that Celastrol decreases body weight gain, ameliorates the gustatory perception of lipids, and downregulates inflammation in obese mice.",

Modified Yupingfeng Granule (MYPFG) is an improved Yupingfeng prescription based on the famous traditional Chinese prescription Yupingfeng (YPF), which is combined with other TCM and has obvious synergistic and additive activity in order to obtain an excellent natural medicine for PWD.MethodsIn this study, 120 weaned Rex rabbits were randomly allocated to 4 treatment groups, including control (CON), low dose (LD), medium dose (MD), high dose (HD). Rabbits were fed a control diet or a different MYPFG proportions of diet for 30 days. The study combined 16S rRNA analysis of intestinal microbiota and cecal contents metabolomics to explore the MYPFG effect on weaned Rex rabbits.ResultsMYPFG increased average daily gain, villus length to crypt depth ratio and decreased the feed to meat ratio, diarrhea frequency, mortality rate, depth of crypt (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The intestinal microbiota test found that MYPFG could change the abundances of Patescibacteria, Sphingobium, Ruminococcus, and Oxalobacter. Metabolomics analysis found that effect may be related to its regulation of Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, Arginine and proline metabolism. Nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism.DiscussionMYPFG could regulate intestinal microbiota and change the metabolic pathway of some amino acids to alleviate the PWD in Rex rabbits.",

A wide range of genetic variability of plant species like Colocasia is available in the region which is consumed by the local tribes.Materials and methodsA field study was conducted during 2022\u201323 to evaluate the yield, biochemical, mineral, and an-tioxidant parameters of 30 Colocasia esculenta L. Schott. genotypes under a split-plot design with three replications.Results and discussionSignificant (p < 0.05) variations were observed among genotypes for all traits. Tamachongkham exhibited the highest corm weight and yield, while Tamitin recorded the maximum cormel weight and total yield. Megha Taro-2 and Megha Taro-1 had the highest cormel numbers and cormel yield, respectively. In mineral composition, Tamitin had the highest N, K, Zn, Cu, and Mn, Tagitung White recorded the highest P, and BCC-2 had the highest Fe and Ca + Mg. Biochemically, Tamachongkham had the highest dry matter content; Khweng-2 had the highest starch, total sugar, and reducing sugar; Rengama had the highest crude protein, and crude fiber; and Mairang Local had the highest ash content. A significant positive correlation was observed between total yield and corm, cormel yield, cormel weight, and corm weight, while correlations with starch and other parameters were non-significant. Total phenolic content and anthocyanin were significantly correlated with Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP). Genotype-by-trait biplot analysis using the first two principal components (PC1: 19.4%, PC2: 14%) high-lighted total sugar, reducing sugar, cormel numbers, crude fiber, anthocyanin, and FRAP as major contributors to phenotypic diversity. The observed variations indicate the potential of these genotypes for future breeding programs aimed at improving taro production in the Eastern Himalayas.",

However, the underlying intrinsic link is not adequately understood. This study aims to investigate the genetic associations between these two types of diseases.MethodsWe obtained summary statistics from large-scale genome-wide association studies of KSD and gastrointestinal diseases, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease and its subtypes, irritable bowel syndrome, and diverticular disease (N=311,254\u2013720,199). Their overall genetic correlations were first estimated. We then detected the shared genetic architecture, including pleiotropic single nucleotide polymorphisms, loci, genes, and biological processes, through cross-trait analyses. In addition, bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis was performed to look for their causal relationships.ResultsWe found significantly positive genetic correlations between KSD and all five gastrointestinal diseases. The cross-trait analysis identified 3184 potential pleiotropic single nucleotide polymorphisms, and 33 of which were pleiotropic loci shared by the two disorders. Gene-level analyses revealed eight pleiotropic causal genes, primarily enriched in biological pathways involving ion homeostasis and response to vitamin D. In the Mendelian randomization analysis, we detected causal effects from gastroesophageal reflux disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and Crohn's disease to KSD, while no reverse causality was observed.ConclusionsOur study demonstrated the positive genetic links between KSD and gastrointestinal diseases and reported pleiotropic variants, loci, and genes, implicating potential biological mechanisms in the pathogenesis of stone disease. These findings further support the role of the gut-kidney axis and provide a genetic basis for the prevention, coregulation, and treatment of these diseases.",

There is substantial evidence that AMD is associated with inflammation. The study aimed to investigate the association between the inflammatory marker, red blood cell distribution width/albumin ratio (RAR), and AMD.MethodsOur study included 5,370 participants aged 40\u202fyears and older, using NHANES data from 2005 to 2008. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between RAR and AMD in the study. Smooth curves and the piecewise linear regression model were used to determine whether the correlation was linear or non-linear. Additionally, subgroup analysis and interaction testing were performed.ResultsWe found a positive linear correlation between RAR and AMD, even after adjusting for covariates. Each unit increase in RAR corresponded to a 30% increase in the odds of AMD prevalence (OR\u202f=\u202f1.3; 95% CI, 1.0\u20131.6). The odds of AMD prevalence were 1.7 times greater in the highest quintile (Q5) group than in the lowest quintile (Q1) group (OR\u202f=\u202f1.7; 95% CI, 1.2\u20132.5). Higher RAR values, compared to lower values, were significantly associated with increased odds of AMD prevalence (p trend < 0.05). Subgroup analyses and interaction tests confirmed the stability of the findings.ConclusionThis study found that there is a positive linear correlation between RAR and the odds of AMD prevalence in United States adults. Further research is necessary to clarify the specific physiological mechanisms underlying the relationship between RAR and AMD.",

    "content": "BackgroundGastrointestinal (GI) cancers, including gastric, colorectal, and esophageal cancers, pose a significant global health burden. Despite advancements in diagnostic tools, early detection remains challenging, particularly in low-resource settings. Emerging evidence highlights the platelet-to-high-density lipoprotein ratio (PHR) as a novel biomarker integrating systemic inflammation and lipid metabolism. However, its association with GI cancer risk remains underexplored.MethodsThis study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2010 to 2018, comprising 19,388 participants, including 230 with GI cancers. PHR was calculated as the ratio of platelet count to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and categorized into quartiles. Weighted logistic regression models, restricted cubic spline analysis, and subgroup analyses were employed to evaluate the association between PHR and GI cancer risk, adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and clinical factors.ResultsElevated PHR was independently associated with an increased risk of GI cancers. Participants in the highest PHR quartile exhibited a significantly higher risk (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20093.09; 95% CI: 2.16\u20134.43) compared to the lowest quartile. A dose-response relationship was observed, with two critical inflection points at PHR values of 3.2 and 4.5. Subgroup analyses revealed stronger associations among older adults, males, and obese individuals. The findings suggest that PHR may reflect the dynamic balance of systemic inflammation and lipid metabolism, contributing to tumorigenesis.ConclusionThis study identifies PHR as a promising, cost-effective biomarker for early detection and risk stratification of GI cancers. Its integration into screening programs could improve precision medicine strategies by identifying high-risk individuals for early intervention. Further longitudinal and mechanistic studies are warranted to confirm these findings and explore the underlying biological mechanisms.",

    "content": "SUMMARYNitrite and nitrate salts are preservatives that act as antimicrobial (bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity) and antioxidant agents in the processing of meat products and confer sensory properties to meat (by creating and preserving colours and flavours). Nitrite is mainly used as a preservative to prevent the growth of Clostridium botulinum and the production of its toxins. However, nitrite and nitrate are also associated with the production of N-nitroso compounds, such as carcinogenic N-nitrosamines, which can have adverse health effects. Therefore, the health risks of these preservatives must be weighed against the need to prevent foodborne pathogens, especially spores of C. botulinum, from infecting food. In this review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using nonthermal technologies as a strategy to partially or totally replace nitrite in meat products, particularly regarding antimicrobial efficacy and N-nitrosamine formation. Methods such as high-pressure processing, pulsed electric fields and cold plasma have been studied for these purposes, but these technologies can alter the sensory properties and stability of foods. Nevertheless, irradiation at lower doses has great potential as a tool for reformulation of cured meat products. It contributes to the reduction of the residual nitrite and consequently to the production of N-nitrosamines while ensuring microbiological safety without significant changes in the product quality.",

Owing to the limitation of human brain biopsy and the challenge of electron microscopy in observing virions in human brain tissue, it has been difficult to study the viral etiology of PD. Recent discovery of virobiota reveals that viruses coexist with humans as symbionts. Newly developed transcriptomic sequencing and novel bioinformatic approaches for mining the encrypted virome in human transcriptome make it possible to study the relationship between symbiotic viruses and PD. Nevertheless, whether viruses exist in the human substantia nigra (SN) and whether symbiotic viruses underlie PD pathogenesis remain unknown. Methods: We collected current worldwide human SN transcriptomic datasets from the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. We used bioinformatic approaches including viruSITE and the Viral-Track to identify the existence of viruses in the SN of patients. The comprehensive RNA sequencing-based virome analysis pipeline was used to characterize the virobiota in the SN. The Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis was used to examine the association between the viral RNA fragment counts (VRFCs) and PD-related human gene sequencing reads in the SN. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the SN between PD patients and non-PD individuals were used to examine the molecular signatures of PD and also evaluate the impact of symbiotic viruses on the SN. Findings: We observed the existence of viruses in the human SN. A dysbiosis of virobiota was found in the SN of PD patients. A marked correlation between VRFC and PD-related human gene expression was detected in the SN of PD patients. These PD-related human genes correlated to VRFC were named as the virus-correlated PD-related genes (VPGs). We identified 3 bacteriophages (phages), including the Proteus phage VB_PmiS-Isfahan, the Escherichia phage phiX174, and the Lactobacillus phage Sha1, that might impair the gene expression of neural cells in the SN of PD patients. The Proteus phage VB_PmiS-Isfahan was a common virus in the SN of patients from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. VPGs and DEGs together highlighted that the phages might dampen dopamine biosynthesis and weaken the cGAS-STING function. Interpretation: This is the first study to discover the involvement of phages in PD pathogenesis. A lifelong low symbiotic viral load in the SN may be a contributor to PD pathogenesis. Our findings unlocked the black box between brain virobiota and PD, providing a novel insight into PD etiology from the perspective of phage\u2013human symbiosis.",

In this study, we explored the effects of a lipid messenger with anti-inflammatory properties \u2013 oleoylethanolamide (OEA) \u2013 on the behavioral deficits caused by social stress in both male and female mice.MethodsAdult mice were assigned to an experimental group according to the stress condition (control or stress) and treatment (vehicle or OEA, 10\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.). Male mice in the stress condition underwent a protocol consisting of four social defeat (SD) encounters. In the case of female mice, we employed a procedure of vicarious SD. After the stress protocol resumed, anxiety, depressive-like behavior, social interaction, and prepulse inhibition (PPI) were assessed. In addition, we characterized the stress-induced inflammatory profile by measuring IL-6 and CX3CL1 levels in the striatum and hippocampus.ResultsOur results showed that both SD and VSD induced behavioral alterations. We found that OEA treatment restored PPI deficits in socially defeated mice. Also, OEA affected differently stress-induced anxiety and depressive-like behavior in male and female mice. Biochemical analyses showed that both male and female stressed mice showed increased levels of IL-6 in the striatum compared to control mice. Similarly, VSD female mice exhibited increased striatal CX3CL1 levels. These neuroinflammation-associated signals were not affected by OEA treatment.ConclusionsIn summary, our results confirm that SD and VSD induced behavioral deficits together with inflammatory signaling in the striatum and hippocampus. We observed that OEA treatment reverses stress-induced PPI alterations in male and female mice. These data suggest that OEA can exert a buffering effect on stress-related sensorimotor gating behavioral processing.",

    "content": "BackgroundThe aim of this study is to analyse the associations of annual Intrinsic Capacities (IC) impairment evolution with the annual cost of care in Nursing Home (NH) residents. This was a prospective, longitudinal and multicenter study. NH residents in the Occitanie region (south of France), 60 years and older with moderate level of dependency were included in the study and were followed during 12 months.MethodsIC was assessed for four of the six IC domains (Cognitive, locomotion, vitality and psychological). Longitudinal IC impairment trajectories of residents were built using the K-means Longitudinal method. Costs were assessed from the healthcare payer\u2019s perspective and include direct medical and non-medical costs. Descriptive analyses of costs and characteristics as well as general linear models were carried out.ResultsThree hundred forty-five residents (86 years old on average and mostly women) were included. Mild, moderate and severe impairment profiles were clustered. For the cognitive domain, we observe a total cost decrease of 1552\u20ac between the most severe impairment profile and the less severe profile, led by medication costs. For the locomotion, psychological and vitality domains we observed a total cost increase of 1,672\u20ac, 3,869 \u20ac and 1,709\u20ac for the most severe impairment profile in comparison with the less severe profile, respectively. This cost increase was driven by hospitalisation for the psychological and the vitality domains and by physiotherapist costs for the locomotion domain. Medication costs decrease with the severity of impairment whatever the IC domain considered.ConclusionsOur study is the first aiming to estimate the association between impairment on IC domains and healthcare costs in NH. The implementation of clusterization highlight resident\u2019s profiles using data driven process, which may facilitate the implementation of personalized health strategies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12877-025-05914-9.",

    "content": "BackgroundEven when older people are discharged directly home after an emergency department (ED) visit, the risk of deterioration of health status and loss of independence persists. We hypothesize that among older adults discharged from the ED, hospital-community transition care provided by geriatric mobile teams (GMTs) may reduce the early readmission rate and level of disability. Such approaches have rarely been evaluated and cannot be generalized yet. Providing evidence of the positive impact of these strategies may influence public health policies.MethodsWe will conduct a national, multicentre, prospective, controlled, quasi-experimental study. All participating centres have an ED and a GMT, some of which provide transitional care. Participants recruited from hospitals where GMT provide transitional care form the \u201cintervention group\u201d, whereas participants recruited from hospitals where GMT provide standard in-hospital management are the \u201ccontrol group\u201d. Inclusion criteria are age\u2009\u2265\u200975 years, returning to personal home after the ED visit (exclusion of nursing home residents) and having a significant risk for early readmission and/or loss of independence after discharge according to a Triage Risk Screening Tool score\u2009\u2265\u20092. The primary objective of this study is to compare hospital ED readmission rates within 30 days. Among secondary objectives, disability scores at 3 and 6 months will be compared between groups. We estimated that 1322 participants, i.e., 661 per group, is required for the main analysis.DiscussionBy conducting this study, we aim to provide more evidence of the effectiveness of transitional care on reducing ED readmissions for older adults, and particularly highlight determinants and effects of hospital-community GMT-led interventions. These strategies can be cost-effective while preserving independence and quality of life. We expect that the results will provide a basis to generalize effective strategies to address the challenges of demographic ageing for healthcare systems.Trial registrationThe study protocol was registered on ClinicalTrial.org (ID NCT05814328 Date 20230414).",

The demand for colored wheat is increasing day by day due to its high content of anthocyanin, iron, zinc, selenium, and other beneficial elements. To investigate the folate content and its derivatives in colored grains wheat, in this study employed a total of 113 wheat varieties (lines) with varying grain colors. The content of four folate derivatives, tetrahydrofolate (THF), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH3-THF), 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-CHO-THF), and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH+THF), in grains cultivated under three different growing conditions were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results revealed that the four folate derivatives were distributed among wheat varieties exhibiting varying grain colors, with a coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 15.34% to 20.10%. Among them, Lin 4179 emerged as a high-folate variety with a total content of 76.00\u00a0\u03bcg \u00b7 100\u00a0g-1. The contents of 5-CH3-THF and 5-CHO-THF in the four folate derivatives accounted for approximately 70% of the total folate content and exhibited a significant correlation with total folate content. The mean total folate level in purple and blue grains was 61.84 and 60.95\u00a0\u03bcg \u00b7 100\u00a0g-1, respectively, which was significantly higher than that in white (41.93\u00a0\u03bcg \u00b7 100\u00a0g\u22121) and red grains (42.40\u00a0\u03bcg \u00b7 100\u00a0g\u22121). The genotypic effect is the main factor affecting total folate content, while environmental factors had less impact. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified four major loci associated with folate content on the chromosomes 1B, 4D and 7A, of which QFac.4D and QFac.7A.1 were stated as novel. The results of this study provide valuable insight into the development and breeding of folate biofortified wheat varieties.",

    "content": "Pregnancy is a period characterized by extensive physiological changes in both the mother and fetus. During this period, the nutritional status of the mother has a profound and irreversible impact on her health and the growth and development of the fetus. The fetus depends exclusively on the mother and drives nutrients through the placenta. Therefore, mothers must be provided with a well-balanced diet that is adequate in both macro- and micronutrients. Most pregnant women generally manage to get adequate macronutrients; however, many women fail to get micronutrients up to the recommended dietary allowance. Micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals are necessary for preventing congenital abnormalities and the optimal development of the brain and body of the fetus. Their inadequacy can lead to complications like anemia, hypertension, pre-eclampsia, maternal and fetal hypothyroidism, premature infants, intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, and other negative pregnancy outcomes. New studies recommend the use of prenatal micronutrient supplements to prevent birth defects and health issues caused by deficiencies in folic acid, iron, iodine, and calcium during pregnancy. This is especially important in developing nations where deficiencies are prevalent. Also while using these supplements, their upper limits (UL) must be considered to avoid overload. In this review, we provide an overview of the four most critical micronutrients during pregnancy: iron, folic acid, iodine, and calcium. We provide insight into their sources, RDAs, deficiency consequences, and the need for supplementation while considering the risk of micronutrient overload.

Folic acid fortification of salt has been proposed as a strategy to control these problems. In preparation for an intervention trial to assess the nutritional effects of folic acid\u2010fortified salt, we measured discretionary salt intakes among nonpregnant WRA using observed weighed food records, and we assessed household salt disappearance rates. We estimated the distribution of usual discretionary salt intake by adjusting for intra\u2010individual variability using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) method, and we simulated the potential effects of two levels of folic acid fortification (30 and 90 ppm folic acid) on folic acid intakes. Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of usual discretionary salt intake was 6.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9\u2009g/day. At the 95th percentile of usual discretionary salt intake, the higher fortification level would provide 918\u2009\u00b5g folic acid/day, which is less than the tolerable upper intake level of 1000\u2009\u00b5g/day. At the 5th percentile of usual discretionary salt intake, the lower fortification level would provide 124\u2009\u00b5g folic acid/day, which should produce a statistically significant increase in red blood cell folate concentration. Estimated household salt utilization was 8.8\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1\u2009g/person/day. These findings inform plans for a randomized, dose\u2013response intervention trial of folic acid\u2010fortified salt and a possible future national program to mandate folic acid fortification of refined, edible salt in Ethiopia.",

Among the key features of MetS, dyslipidemia\u2014characterized by altered levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG)\u2014plays a crucial role in the disorder\u2019s progression. This review aims to elucidate the intricate interplay between HDL-C and TG within the context of lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health, while also addressing the detrimental impact of various cardiovascular risk factors and associated comorbidities. The dynamics of HDL-C and TG are explored, highlighting their reciprocal relationship and respective contributions to the pathophysiology of MetS. Elevated levels of TGs are consistently associated with reduced concentrations of HDL-C, resulting in a lipid profile that promotes the development of vascular disease. Specifically, as TG levels rise, the protective cardiovascular effects of HDL-C are diminished, leading to the increased accumulation of pro-atherogenic TG-rich lipoproteins and low-density lipoprotein particles within the vascular wall, contributing to the progression of atheromas, which can ultimately result in significant ischemic cardiovascular events. Ultimately, this paper underscores the significance of HDL and TG as essential targets for therapeutic intervention, emphasizing their potential in effectively managing MetS and reducing cardiovascular risk.",

The total energy intake reported in the FFQ was below the recommended values; however, 71% of subjects were classified as low energy reporters (LERs). Energy intake from proteins was within and from carbohydrates was below the recommended interval, while the total energy intake from fats (and also saturated fatty acids) exceeded the recommendations. Suboptimal intakes of vitamin D and folate were observed, indicating the necessity for monitoring (and supplementing) in this population. High Na intake, which despite adequate K intake resulted in a higher Na-to-K ratio, highlighted concerns over excessive salt consumption, but also accentuated the need for monitoring sodium (and potassium) intake in competitive athletes with consideration for sweat-related losses.",

The rising incidence rate and disability rate pose a serious challenge to public health and socio-economic development. Traditional medication and psychotherapy are positive, but they often come with limitations such as side effects, poor compliance, and resource constraints, which highlights the urgent need for more proactive and sustainable non pharmacological interventions. We mainly explored the physiological and psychological mechanisms of exercise in alleviating depression in different age groups. In particular, we evaluated the characteristics and influencing factors of depression in each age group and compared the pathways through which exercise works, aiming to provide scientific basis for clinical practice and public health policies, and strengthen the application of non pharmacological treatment in depression management. It is worth noting that, in the context of a comprehensive search and analysis of recent literature, we have covered the epidemiology of depression, the impact of exercise on mental health, the characteristics of depression in different age groups, and the specific ways in which exercise alleviates depression through physiological and psychological mechanisms. Exercise alleviates symptoms of depression by regulating neurotransmitters, enhancing neuroplasticity, regulating hormone levels, reducing inflammatory responses through physiological pathways, as well as enhancing cognitive function, strengthening emotional regulation, triggering social interactions, and improving self-efficacy through psychological pathways. The differences in physiological and psychological mechanisms among different age groups determine the age dependent characteristics of exercise in mitigating depression. Teenagers, middle-aged people, and elderly people can improve depressive symptoms by enhancing neural progression, regulating stress responses, and strengthening social support, respectively.",

We examined whether an increased genetic risk for CAD is associated with long-term risk of developing all-cause, Alzheimer\u2019s, or vascular dementia, and investigated whether differences in potentially modifiable lifestyle factors in the mid- to late-life period may attenuate this risk.METHODS:A prospective cohort study of 365 782 participants free from dementia for at least 5 years after baseline assessment was conducted within the UK Biobank cohort. Genetic risk was assessed using a genomewide polygenic risk score (PRS) for CAD and lifestyle risk using a modified version of the American Heart Association\u2019s Life\u2019s Essential 8 Lifestyle Risk Score (LRS). Higher values for both scores were deemed to represent increased risk. Primary outcomes were incident all-cause, Alzheimer\u2019s, and vascular dementia diagnoses obtained from self-report and electronic health records. Secondary outcomes were neuroimaging phenotypes measured in 32 028 participants recalled for magnetic resonance imaging. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the extent by which biological and behavioral risk factors contributed to observed associations.RESULTS:A total of 8870 cases of all-cause dementia were observed over a median 13.9-year follow-up. Both genetic (PRS) and lifestyle (LRS) risk scores for CAD were associated with a modestly elevated risk of all-cause dementia (subhazard ratio per SD increase, 1.10 [1.08, 1.12], P<0.001, for PRS and 1.04 [1.02, 1.06], P=0.006, for LRS). This risk appeared largely attributable to underlying vascular dementia diagnoses (subhazard ratio, 1.16 [1.11, 1.21], P<0.001 for PRS and 1.15 [1.09, 1.22], P<0.001, for LRS), because Alzheimer\u2019s disease was found to demonstrate moderate associations with PRS alone (subhazard ratio, 1.09 [1.06, 1.13]; P<0.001). LRS was found to have an additive rather than interactive effect with PRS, with individuals in the highest tertiles for both genetic and lifestyle risk for CAD \u224870% more likely to develop vascular dementia during follow-up compared with those in the lowest tertiles for both (subhazard ratio, 1.71 [1.39, 2.11]; P<0.001). This was substantially attenuated in those with a low LRS at baseline, however, regardless of underlying genetic risk (30% reduction for low versus high LRS tertile regardless of PRS tertile; P<0.001 for all). In a subset of individuals recalled for neuroimaging assessments, those in the highest tertiles for genetic and lifestyle risk for CAD demonstrated a \u224825% greater volume of white matter hyperintensities than those in the lowest risk tertiles, but showed little difference in gray matter or hippocampal volumes. Sensitivity analyses identified associations between both biological and behavioral risk scores with white matter hyperintensity burden and vascular dementia, whereas some Alzheimer\u2019s dementia associations showed seemingly paradoxical relationships.CONCLUSIONS:Individuals who are genetically predisposed to developing CAD also face an increased risk of developing dementia in old age. This risk is reduced in those demonstrating healthy lifestyle profiles earlier in the lifespan, particularly in those who may be at an increased risk of developing dementia caused by an underlying vascular pathology.",

For persons aged \u226435 years, structural heart disease, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is historically the most common etiology. Regarding individuals aged >35 years, coronary artery disease is the main contributor to SCD during exercise.Indications:Though some athletes may endure prodromal symptoms prior to a SCA, approximately 25% to 50% do not. Up to 23,000 people aged <18 years die from SCA annually. SCA athlete deaths are reported to be the most common medical cause of death and the second most common overall behind motor vehicle accidents in this population. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge SCA prevalence and identify at-risk competitors.Technique Description:If a SCA is suspected, first assess surroundings for safety and athlete response to commands. Should there be no pulse, activate code. If necessary, an athlete\u2019s shirt may be removed or cut to better access the bare chest for the automated external defibrillator (AED) pads. Apply pads and commence compressions. Refer to the AED for a shockable rhythm between compression cycles. Establish intravenous access as appropriate and if feasible. After 1 cycle of compressions, a shock is administered when a shockable rhythm is detected. Resume compressions if a pulse is not reestablished. If a pulse is reestablished, the athlete should then be immediately transported to the hospital.Results:A literature review yields illustration of the multifactorial criteria that comprise return-to-sports guidelines, including activity intensity, extent of cardiac disease, and psychological/physical benefit from sport. SCD incidence is higher in competitive versus recreational athletes. In general, consolidation of these investigations makes it apparent that utilizing a shared decision-making process and a progressive exercise program is warranted prior to play resumption in most cases. The greatest SCA/SCD survival determinant is collapse to defibrillation time.Discussion/Conclusion:The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology and the European Society of Cardiology recommend preparticipation cardiac screening to identify cardiac conditions that predispose to SCA/SCD risk. SCD prevention in athletes hinges on the prompt availability of quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation and AEDs.Patient Consent Disclosure Statement:The author(s) attests that consent has been obtained from any patient(s) appearing in this publication.

The synthesis of the new indole-based carboxamide derivatives IMW 1\u201316 was guided by molecular docking experiments with the SIRT3 wild-type protein. FT-IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and mass spectrometry analyzed the synthesized compounds.

The research was conducted in two parts. First, a global analysis of publicly available data (2019\u20132021) explored the association between nutritional factors and CVD prevalence across 183 countries. Second, a cross-sectional study involving 67 children (33 with obesity and 34 with healthy weight, classified using BMI Z-scores) examined the correlation between serum LA levels and WHtR. Global analysis revealed a moderate correlation between low seafood omega-3 fatty acid intake and CVD incidence (rho = 0.341), while low polyunsaturated fatty acid consumption showed a weak correlation (rho = 0.228). In children, a significant positive correlation was observed between serum LA levels and WHtR (rho = 0.716, p < 0.001), with similar correlations found when stratified by sex (girls: rho = 0.690; boys: rho = 0.709). Serum LA levels also correlated positively with weight (rho = 0.684).

Obesity was induced with a high\u2010fat diet for 60\u2009days and managed with oils and orlistat for 28\u2009days. The rats were sacrificed on the 29th day, and the serum and blood were collected. The serum was used to evaluate oxidative stress and cytokine markers, while the blood was used for hematology studies. Results showed that oil quality indices were within standard ranges as recommended by the norm. Hematological assessments showed no significant differences in most parameters across groups, except for platelet counts, which were lower in the group taking 100% of groundnut oil. Catalase activity and glutathione peroxidase (GSH) levels were evaluated in various organs. The normal group exhibited the highest catalase activity in the brain and liver compared with the rats that received the high\u2010fat diet. Notably, GSH activity was higher in the brains of rats receiving the 60:40 blend. Thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values indicated lower oxidative stress in the normal and 100% walnut oil groups. Nitric oxide concentrations were significantly higher in the normal and walnut oil groups compared with the negative control, suggesting a protective effect against oxidative stress. Cytokine analysis revealed elevated inflammatory markers in the negative control group, highlighting the potential anti\u2010inflammatory properties of the oils. These findings suggest that groundnut oil, African walnut oil, and their blends might have anti\u2010inflammatory activities, might preserve hematological markers, and protect against oxidative stress.",

    "content": "BackgroundEnvironmental management in the Israeli health system is driven primarily by safety regulations. Such regulations aim to reduce hazardous exposures to employees, patients, and visitors, as well as some specific aspects of broader environmental toxicity to humans and nature. Most environmental precautions in the system target traditional exposures and do not specifically consider the health system\u2019s own impact on climate change. This article aims to justify incorporating climate change mitigation actions into short- and long-term plans in Israeli health organizations and present a schematic strategic roadmap to do so.Main bodyClimate change poses many threats to global health, including risks from severe weather events, changes in vector-borne diseases, increased hazardous air pollutants, food and water shortages, and adverse effects on reproductive health. The most effective effort in climate change mitigation is reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. Ignoring the health sector\u2019s emissions contradicts the ancient medical principle: first, do no harm (primum non-nocere). Furthermore, many climate mitigation methods introduce additional health co-benefits. Special attention and medical considerations are needed to safely reduce emissions from the health sector. This article reviews healthcare\u2019s most common emission sources, including energy consumption, transportation, food, waste, supplies, and the supply chain. An organizational carbon management strategy should include recognizing the problem and committing to action, estimating the organizational carbon footprint, developing and prioritizing alternative interventions, and developing a carbon management plan with measurable short- and intermediate-term goals.ConclusionClimate mitigation in the health sector is encompassed by the moral obligation of the Israeli healthcare system to do no harm. Performance measures to support GHG emission reductions should be adopted into the existing, successful Israeli programs of quality measures in medicine, both in the community and hospitals. In addition, Israel academic institutions for health and medical education should incorporate sustainable health into their curricula for students of health professions and as part of continuous medical education. Such policy actions will contribute to a healthy health system that supports climate change mitigation while providing health co-benefits to the Israeli population.",

There is a complex mechanism of the pathogenesis of COPD, and no specific drugs are currently available to reverse the progressive decline in lung function during the natural course of COPD. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) not only alleviates clinical symptoms, but also leads to fewer adverse reactions. However, the mechanism of action of TCM in COPD treatment remains unclear.AimTo summarize the mechanisms of action of Chinese herbal compounds and natural drugs in the treatment of COPD and identify potential signaling pathways and targets that can provide preclinical evidence for the treatment of COPD.MethodsLiterature was retrieved from the scientific databases PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, and VIP Chinese Science and Technology Journal from July 2007 to December 2023.ResultsThis study introduced the specific pathways, targets and mechanisms of TCM in treating COPD from the perspectives of inhibiting inflammation, reducing oxidative stress, and regulating autophagy.ConclusionThis study provides a comprehensive summary of the theories of Chinese medicine in treating COPD, which utilize multiple targets and pathways to display the advantages of Chinese medicine.

The results will provide reference for related research on ferroptosis in IS.MethodsThe ferroptosis-related targets were obtained from the GeneCards, GeneCLiP3, and FerrDdb databases, while the IS targets were sourced from the GeneCards and DisGeNET databases. Venny was used to identify IS targets associated with ferroptosis. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was then conducted, and machine learning screening was used to validate these potential targets. The potential targets that met specific criteria and their related compounds allowed us to select TCMs. A mechanistic analysis of the potential targets was conducted using the DAVID database. PPI network diagrams, target-compound network diagrams, and target-compound-TCM network diagrams were then constructed. Finally, molecular docking technology was used to verify the binding activities of the TCM compounds and core components with the identified targets. In addition, the properties, flavors, meridian tropism, and therapeutic effects of the candidate TCMs were analyzed and statistically evaluated.ResultsA total of 706 targets associated with ferroptosis in IS were obtained, and 14 potential ferroptosis targets in IS were obtained using machine learning. Furthermore, 413 compounds and 301 TCMs were screened, and the binding activities of the targets to the TCM compounds and the core prescriptions were stable. The candidate TCMs primarily exhibited cold, warm, bitter taste, pungent taste, liver meridian, heat-cleaning medicinal, and tonify deficiency properties.ConclusionsThis study investigated ferroptosis regulation for IS intervention using TCM. We began by investigating the targets of IS and ferroptosis, and we also analyzed the relevant mechanism of ferroptosis in IS.

    "content": "IntroductionChylothorax is defined by the accumulation of chyle in the pleural space, characterized by triglyceride levels exceeding 110 milligrams per deciliter. The clinical presentation of chylothorax varies depending on its acuity and underlying etiology. Mediastinal lymphangiomas are extremely rare and benign lesions that can affect both infants and adults. They may occur independently or in association with other lymphatic disorders and can lead to complications such as chylothorax.Case reportA 60-year-old male patient presented with shortness of breath and was diagnosed with left-sided chylothorax secondary to mediastinal lymphangioma, accompanied by intestinal lymphangiomatosis. Conservative approach was unsuccessful, and surgical therapy was needed.Materials and methodsWe conducted a thorough search of the PubMed/MEDLINE, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar databases. The search parameters we used included the following Boolean terms: [(\u201clymphangioma\u201d OR \u201cmediastinal lymphangioma\u201d OR \u201ccavernous lymphangiomas\u201d OR \u201ccystic hygromas\u201d OR \u201ccapillary lymphangioma\u201d OR \u201clymphangioma simplex\u201d) AND (\u201cchylothorax\u201d OR \u201cchylous pleural effusion\u201d OR \u201cchylous effusion\u201d OR \u201cchylous lung\u201d)]. Our search yielded 166 articles in total, out of which we selected 17 articles for inclusion. We included patients who presented to the hospital with chylothorax secondary to mediastinal lymphangioma and those who developed chylothorax after the removal of mediastinal lymphangioma. The primary outcome was the total number of reported cases of chylothorax secondary to mediastinal lymphangioma. The secondary outcomes included patient characteristics, fluid characteristics, clinical manifestations, and therapeutic modalities.ResultsThe systematic review encompassed seventeen case reports. Most patients were male, spanning ages from six weeks to 82 years, with an average age of 28.35 years. Most pleural effusions were on the left side. Few cases were asymptomatic, while the most reported symptom was shortness of breath. The mean pleural triglyceride level was 708\u00a0mg/dl, with cystic hygroma being the most common subtype. The anterior mediastinum was the most frequent location. The primary treatment involved surgical removal of the lymphangioma along with thoracic duct ligation.ConclusionMediastinal lymphangioma is an infrequent etiology of chylothorax and is scarcely documented in the literature. It may be present in isolation or may be associated with extra mediastinal lymphatic anomalies. The management of chylothorax in such cases is challenging with conservative measures often being ineffective, necessitating surgical intervention. The rarity of these conditions complicates the study of potential risk factors and genetic predispositions. Furthermore, there is no established consensus on the therapeutic modalities for patients with similar diagnoses which vary based on patient characteristics.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12890-025-03664-3.",

The aim of the study is to explore the efficacy of autologous muscle flap or myocutaneous flap on chronic empyema with BPF.MethodsRetrospective analysis of 10 patients with postoperative chronic empyema with BPF treated in our hospital, including 8 males and 2 females, with ages ranging from 20 to 83\u2009years, yielding an average age of (51.00\u2009\u00b1\u200919.22) years. The treatment of all patients with chronic empyema follows a staged surgical model. The first stage of surgery involves debridement, partial rib resection, and fistula closure, while the second stage includes autologous muscle flap transposition or free myocutaneous flap transplantation to eliminate the abscess cavity. The primary objectives of the first-stage surgery include ensuring adequate drainage, controlling infection, and achieving fistula closure. In contrast, the key focus of the second-stage surgery is the complete filling of the abscess cavity with a sufficient volume of autologous tissue flap.ResultsThere were no perioperative deaths. The average follow-up was (19.88\u2009\u00b1\u20099.03) months. None of the 10 patients had recurrence of empyema and BPF. All autologous muscle flaps or myocutaneous flaps survived. Postoperative chest computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the abscess cavity disappeared.ConclusionsThe application of autologous muscle flap or myocutaneous flap represents an effective approach for the treatment of chronic empyema with BPF, demonstrating satisfactory clinical outcomes in the short to medium term.",

    "content": "Background: Nut consumption has been considered a potential protective factor against cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to test whether higher total and specific nut intake was associated with better cognitive status in a sample of older Italian adults. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis on 883 older adults (>50 y) was conducted. A 110-item food frequency questionnaire was used to collect information on the consumption of various types of nuts. The Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire was used to assess cognitive status. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between nut intake and cognitive status after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Results: The median intake of total nuts was 11.7 g/day and served as a cut-off to categorize low and high consumers (mean intake 4.3 g/day vs. 39.7 g/day, respectively). Higher total nut intake was significantly associated with a lower prevalence of impaired cognitive status among older individuals (OR = 0.35, CI 95%: 0.15, 0.84) after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Notably, this association remained significant after additional adjustment for adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern as an indicator of diet quality, (OR = 0.32, CI 95%: 0.13, 0.77). No significant associations were found between cognitive status and specific types of nuts. Conclusions: Habitual nut intake is associated with better cognitive status in older adults.",

The phytochemical resveratrol has shown promising anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in AD, but it has low bioavailability. Chemical modification of resveratrol to its glycosylated form, polydatin (PD), significantly increases its bioavailability and bioactivity.PurposeThe study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of action of PD against AD in rats.Material and methodAD was caused by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of aluminum chloride (AlCl3). Six groups of six rats each were defined as sham, negative control (AlCl3), positive control (Donepezil), and treatments (PD 5, 10, and 20\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.). On days 7, 8, 14, and 15, the rats\u2019 behavioral changes were assessed by the open field, Y-maze test, passive avoidance test, and elevated plus maze tests. At the end of the study, the blood samples were collected to assess the levels of glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), and nitrite, as well as the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Furthermore, hippocampal brain tissue was removed and used for histological investigations.Results and discussionThe findings revealed that PD injections at three different doses (5, 10, and 20\u00a0mg/kg) improved cognitive and other behavioral impairments. Furthermore, PD improved the antioxidant capacity by increasing GSH and CAT while decreasing serum nitrite levels. PD showed anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the activity of inflammatory MMP-9, while elevating the activity of anti-inflammatory MMP-2. PD also modulated pathogenic changes in the hippocampal brain tissue.ConclusionPD alleviated cognitive and other behavioral impairments in AD rats by enhancing antioxidant defenses and reducing neuroinflammation.",

    "content": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by persistent inflammation and progressive joint destruction. Recent data underscore oxidative stress as a primary factor in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis, intensifying inflammatory processes and tissue damage via the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and compromised antioxidant defenses. Current therapies, including disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), primarily target immune dysregulation but fail to address oxidative stress, necessitating novel adjunctive treatment strategies. This review explores the potential of antioxidant-based therapies as complementary approaches to RA management. Natural compounds such as curcumin, resveratrol, sulforaphane, and propolis exhibit strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties by modulating redox-sensitive pathways, including nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Nrf2)/heme oxygenase (HO-1). N-acetylcysteine (NAC) replenishes intracellular glutathione, enhancing cellular resilience against oxidative stress. Additionally, molecular hydrogen (H2) selectively neutralizes harmful ROS, reducing oxidative damage and inflammation. The role of vitamin supplementation (D, B12, C, and K) in regulating immune responses and protecting joint structures is also discussed. This review aims to evaluate the efficacy and potential clinical applications of antioxidant therapies in RA, emphasizing their role in mitigating oxidative damage and improving treatment outcomes. While preliminary findings are promising, further clinical trials are needed to establish standardized dosing, long-term safety, and their integration into current RA treatment protocols.",

In this study, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential of VA was explored in vitro and ex vivo in human immune cells and non-cellular models. In neutrophils, VA significantly downregulated the fMLP-induced oxidative burst and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS); it also suppressed the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-8) and the tissue-remodeling enzyme elastase-2 (ELA-2) in cells stimulated with LPS and fMLP+cytochalasin B. Additionally, VA showed good biocompatibility with human neutrophils and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) across the tested concentrations of 1\u201350 \u00b5g/mL. Furthermore, VA at 1\u20135 \u03bcg/mL enhanced the non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity of human plasma (NEAC) and prevented oxidative and nitrative damage to plasma proteins by protecting tyrosine moieties and thiols from peroxynitrite. VA also inhibited lipid peroxidation and the formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (at 50 \u03bcg/mL) and protein-bound carbonyls (at 5\u201350 \u03bcg/mL) in peroxynitrite-treated plasma. In non-cellular tests, VA acted as a hypochlorous acid and hydrogen peroxide scavenger and inhibited non-enzymatic protein glycation, outperforming the references Trolox and aminoguanidine.

Chronic systemic inflammation promotes endothelial dysfunction and accelerates atherosclerosis, increasing cardiovascular risk. Methods: Current data were analyzed to explore the mechanisms between RA and CVD, focusing on systemic inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokine patways (IL-1, IL-6, TNF, and JAK-STAT), and their interactions with traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Recent studies and clinical guidelines were reviewed to highlight gaps and advances in risk assessment and management. Results: Persistent disease activity and the presence of autoantibodies significantly increase cardiovascular risk in RA contributing to atherosclerosis and major cardiovascular events. Data also suggest that anti-inflammatory treatments, including methotrexate and biologic agents, may lower this risk. Conclusion: This review highlights the pathophysiological mechanisms between RA and CVD, and the need for early diagnosis and active monitoring to identify and assess cardiovascular risk. A multidisciplinary approach, involving rheumatologists and cardiologists is essential for optimizing cardiovascular risk management and improving patient outcomes. Optimization of cardiovascular risk management strategies in patients with RA should be an essential component of current medical practice, with the main goal of reducing morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular complications.",

After 7 days of culture, the biomaterial modulated the expression of key genes involved in osteogenesis and chondrogenesis, which are known for their role in bone formation and maturation. At the same time, a downregulation of genes associated with bone resorption was observed. Secretome analysis revealed a controlled release of pro-regenerative cytokines, suggesting a role of the biomaterial in modulating inflammation to promote bone regeneration. Furthermore, immunofluorescence confirmed the high expression of osteocalcin and osteopontin, which are key markers of bone mineralization.

A systematic sampling technique was used to enrol study participant Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected by trained nurses. The Dermatitis Family Impact (DFI) questionnaire to assess QoL and the SCORAD index to measure the severity of the diseases. Descriptive statistics, Spearman rank correlation, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for data analysis, with p-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant.ResultsOut of 461 AD-diagnosed children, 212 (46%) were girls, and 249 (54%) were boys. The mean DFI score was 9.64 (\u00b1 6.44), with 32.3% presenting with mild AD, 46.2% being moderate, and 21.5% with severe AD.

As a secondary objective, its associations with incident heart failure (HF), coronary heart disease (CHD), and stroke were measured.MethodsThe UK Biobank is a prospective cohort study comprising over 500,000 participants recruited in the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010, aged 37 to 73 years. A total of 447,950 participants did not have prevalent AF, and 423,946 participants who were free of HF, CHD, and stroke at baseline were included. Water hardness was assessed by CaCO3 concentration. The genetic risk score for AF was based on the standard polygenic risk score. Cox proportional hazards regression models and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis were conducted.ResultsDuring a median follow-up of 13.74 years, 30,726 (6.86%) individuals were diagnosed with AF for the first time. Compared with those with water hardness\u2009\u2264\u200960\u00a0mg/L, individuals with domestic water hardness 121\u2013180\u00a0mg/L had a 17% lower risk of developing AF (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.79\u20130.87), but water hardness of 61-120\u00a0mg/L and >\u2009180\u00a0mg/L was associated with a higher risk of incident AF (both 1.04, 1.01\u20131.07). A non-linear relationship between water hardness and incident AF (P for non-linear\u2009=\u20090.001) was found. Individuals with water hardness 121-180\u00a0mg/L were also significantly associated with a lower risk of incident HF (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75\u20130.89), CHD (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.76\u20130.84) and stroke (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81\u20130.95). There were no significant interaction effects between water hardness level and genetic susceptibility to AF, HF, CHD, and stroke risk (all P for interaction\u2009>\u20090.05).ConclusionPotential U-shaped associations between domestic water hardness and incident AF across varying levels of genetic risk were found. Hard water (121\u2013180\u00a0mg/L) may offer the most benefits compared to soft water when considering overall cardiovascular health, including AF, HF, CHD, and stroke.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12940-025-01166-7.",

Current research suggests a correlation between serum vitamin D level and AD severity and that vitamin D supplementation could have a potential therapeutic effect on AD. Objectives: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of vitamin D supplementation for disease improvement in children and adults with AD. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane were searched from 19 April to 20 April 2024. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with AD comparing an intervention group with a control group. The risk of bias of the selected studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. All analyses were conducted in R (v4.1.2; R Core Team 2021). Results: Eleven RCTs with 686 participants were included. The included trials had measured AD severity by using the SCOring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) or the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). Vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced AD severity compared with the control group (standardized mean difference = \u22120.41, 95% CI: \u22120.67 to \u22120.16, I2 = 58%, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Vitamin D supplementation reduces AD severity in children and adults. Larger-scale and longer-term studies are still needed to confirm this conclusion.

Ganoderma lucidum, a food-medicine homologous in China, has been used to treat diabetes. This study was aimed to explore the active ingredients and mechanism of G. lucidum in the treatment of diabetes.Materials and MethodsRelevant compounds and targets of Ganoderma were collected from the TCMSP database, BATMAN-TCM database, relevant literature and PubChem. A diabetes-related target database was constructed using TTD, BATMAN-TCM, and Uniprot. A PPI network and H-C-T-P network were constructed to analyze interactions among these targets. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed using WebGestalt. Molecular docking of the core compounds and key targets was carried out using AutoDock Vina. The predicted key targets were verified via qRT-PCR in PA-induced HepG2 cells, using GLAE (ethanol extract of Ganoderma lucidum) as the treatment.ResultsA total of 58 compounds were screened out in G. lucidum, of which 17\u00a0had predicted targets. G. lucidum was involved in metabolic processes, such as lipid binding, insulin secretion, and other pathways. Molecular docking results showed that the core component \u03b2-sitosterol had strong binding activity with key targets CASP3, PRKACA, and PGR. Based on the results of network pharmacology, the top 10 targets related to glucose and lipid metabolism were selected for validation. The results indicated that in a high-fat environment, glucose and lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells was improved, with decreased mRNA expression of CASP3, PRKACA, CYP19A1, NR3C1, JUN, and increased expression of PGR and RXRA.ConclusionGlucose and lipid metabolism are important for the anti-diabetic activity of G. lucidum. A strong interaction of \u03b2-sitosterol with CASP3, PRKACA, and PGR, which may be related to cell apoptosis, gluconeogenesis and insulin secretion, etc. This study lays the foundational groundwork for future drug development and therapeutic optimization.",

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of fucoxanthin-loaded nanoliposomes in yogurt on its antioxidant, physicochemical, and rheological properties under cold storage (21 days). Fucoxanthin-loaded nanoliposomes were prepared using the ultrasonic film dispersion technique and added at concentrations of 0%, 5%, and 10% in the yogurt (Y-C, Y-FXN-5, Y-FXN-10). Homogeneous and uniform nanoliposomes (98.28 nm) were obtained, preserving their integrity and functionality and ensuring the prolonged release and bioavailability of fucoxanthin. Y-FXN-10 maintained the highest antioxidant activity according to the DPPH (52.96%), ABTS (97.97%), and FRAP (3.16 mmol ET/g) methods. This formulation exhibited enhanced erythroprotective potential, inhibiting hemolysis, photohemolysis, and heat-induced hemolysis. However, viscosity and firmness decreased, affecting the texture and appearance. Sensory properties such as the color, flavor, aftertaste, texture, and overall acceptance improved with the 10% fucoxanthin-enriched yogurt formulation.

External stress factors, such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation, pollution, and toxin exposure, increase oxidative stress, damage cellular repair mechanisms, and speed up aging processes. With the rise in the world\u2019s aging population, there are enlarged demands for the use of sustainable natural products in food, nutrient supplements and cosmetics that can slow down aging and prolong healthy life and longevity. Algae, including both macroalgae and microalgae, have been recognised as a source of valuable proteins, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals useful for human consumption and medical applications. With increasing demands for nutraceutical and pharmaceutical bioproducts from environmentally friendly resources, the biotechnological industry, over recent decades, has had to provide new, advanced solutions using modern high-throughput omics technologies. The application of proteomics in the area of discoveries of natural products with anti-aging properties has become more popular for wide industry applications. New proteomics profiling provides a better understanding of changes occurring in protein and peptide content, their structure, function and interactions, as well as the regulatory processes and molecular pathways. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has been used for a wide range of applications including protein identification, characterisation, as well as quantification of proteins within the proteome and sub-proteome. The application of chemical proteomics facilitated the identification of natural products approach and included the synthesis of probes and target fishing, allowing the advanced identification of proteins of interest.

    "content": "BackgroundUnderstanding sarcopenia is becoming increasingly important as society ages. This comprehensive review covers the definition, epidemiology, causes, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, management, and future directions for the management of sarcopenia, and the major issues related to sarcopenia in the knee joint.Main textSarcopenia, a condition related to aging, is characterized by decreased muscle mass and strength, which significantly affects physical function. Its prevalence may vary by region and age, with reports of up to 50% prevalence in the elderly population. The potential causes of sarcopenia include neurodegeneration, poor nutrition, changes in hormonal effects, elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and reduced activation of muscle satellite cells. Various pathogeneses, such as apoptosis, proteolysis, and inhibition of the signaling for increasing muscle mass, contribute to the development of sarcopenia. Generally, the diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia are based on reduced muscle mass, reduced muscle strength, and decreased physical performance, and can be assessed using various equipment and clinical tests. A healthy lifestyle consisting of a balanced diet, sufficient protein intake, and regular exercise is recommended to prevent sarcopenia. The management of sarcopenia involves resistance exercise, proper nutrition, and deprescribing from polypharmacy. In the future, pharmacological treatment and personalized nutrition may become alternative management options for sarcopenia. Finally, since sarcopenia can be associated with knee osteoarthritis and poor outcomes after total knee arthroplasty, appropriate management of sarcopenia is important for physicians treating knee-related conditions.ConclusionsSarcopenia is a significant pathological condition that needs to be recognized, especially in the older population. Although sarcopenia is common as aging occurs, it can be prevented by a healthy lifestyle. Currently, there are no approved drugs for sarcopenia; however, resistance exercise and proper nutritional supplementation are essential methods for managing sarcopenic conditions. Given its diverse causes, a personalized approach may be necessary to effectively manage sarcopenia. Finally, appropriate management of sarcopenia can contribute to the prevention and effective treatment of knee osteoarthritis.",

This study explores the effectiveness of a comprehensive digital health program, RESET care, which integrates personalized dietary plans, structured exercise, and cognitive behavioral therapy delivered through a mobile app equipped with Internet of Things devices such as body composition analyzers and smartwatches. Metabolic dysfunction-associated liver disease (MASLD), a global health burden affecting approximately 25% of the population, demands sustainable lifestyle modifications as its primary management strategy. The study reports that 100% of participants in the comprehensive intervention group (diet + exercise + cognitive behavioral therapy) achieved a weight reduction \u2265 7% (6.99 \u00b1 2.98 kg, 7.00% \u00b1 3.39%; P = 0.002), a clinically significant threshold for MASLD improvement. In addition, participants showed a mean weight reduction of 6.99 kg (101.10 \u00b1 17.85 vs 94.11 \u00b1 17.38, P < 0.001) and a body mass index reduction of 2.18 kg/m\u00b2 (32.90 \u00b1 3.02 vs 30.72 \u00b1 3.41, P < 0.001). These results underscore the potential of digital health platforms to provide scalable, evidence-based solutions for the treatment of MASLD. While these results highlight the potential of digital platforms in the scalable and personalized management of MASLD, the small study sample size and short duration of follow-up limit the generalizability of the results. Future large-scale, long-term trials are needed to confirm sustained benefits, cost-effectiveness, and broader applicability.

    "content": "Background: Lipedema is a chronic disorder characterized by disproportionate fat accumulation in the extremities, predominantly affecting women. Unlike obesity, lipedema might be associated with a lower prevalence of metabolic alterations despite often coexisting with overweight or obesity. Fat distribution plays a crucial role in metabolic differences, with gynoid fat in lipedema being associated with a lower risk of insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. The present study aims to compare biochemical parameters between women with lipedema and those with lifestyle-induced overweight/obesity. Methods: This study involved 108 women, including 53 with lipedema and 55 with lifestyle-induced overweight/obesity. Anthropometric measurements and body composition analyses were conducted, and biochemical parameters related to liver function, lipid profile, kidney and thyroid function, uric acid levels, and carbohydrate metabolism were assessed. Statistical comparisons were made between groups, and multivariate models were used to explore the relationships between disease type, metabolic parameters, and body composition. Results: Women with lipedema exhibited a more favorable metabolic profile than those with overweight/obesity. Dyslipidemia was observed in ~50% of the lipedema group, compared to nearly 70% in the overweight/obesity group. Impaired glucose metabolism and insulin resistance were significantly less prevalent in the lipedema group (18.9% vs. 43.6%, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Despite having a high BMI, women with lipedema demonstrate fewer metabolic alterations than those with overweight/obesity. Fat distribution, rather than overall adiposity, appears to influence metabolic risk. These findings highlight the need for targeted therapeutic approaches to lipedema, distinct from conventional obesity management strategies.",

    "content": "Background/Objectives: Gastric cancer remains a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Reliable biomarkers are crucial for early detection, prognostication, and therapy monitoring. While classical tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen (CA)19-9, CA72-4, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) are used in clinical practice, their accuracy can be limited. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) is an inflammatory cytokine implicated in tumor progression, yet its relationship with established gastric cancer tumor markers has not been fully clarified. This study aimed to determine whether elevated TNF-\u03b1 correlates with key tumor markers and disease stage in gastric cancer. Methods: In this prospective observational study, we enrolled 80 gastric cancer patients and 20 non-neoplastic controls. Baseline clinical data, laboratory parameters, and tumor markers (CEA, CA19-9, CA72-4, AFP) were recorded. TNF-\u03b1 concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Correlation analyses and multivariate regression were performed to assess the relationship of TNF-\u03b1 with tumor markers, inflammatory indices, and disease stage. Results: TNF-\u03b1 was significantly elevated in gastric cancer patients (median 4.5 pg/mL) compared to controls (2.9 pg/mL). TNF-\u03b1 showed a robust correlation with CA19-9 (rho = 0.502) and CA72-4 (rho = 0.385), and a moderate correlation with CEA (rho = 0.279). TNF-\u03b1 concentrations were highest in Stage IV disease and in the intestinal-type histology. In regression analysis, only CA19-9 and CA72-4 remained independent predictors of TNF-\u03b1 after controlling for clinical confounders. Conclusions: TNF-\u03b1 is strongly associated with CA19-9 and CA72-4 and rises with advancing stage, highlighting its potential as an adjunct marker for assessing gastric cancer burden. These findings provide a rationale for further research on TNF-\u03b1 as both a prognostic biomarker and a possible therapeutic target in gastric cancer.",

    "content": "The cloning and mass production of recombinant cytokine proteins opened a new world of treatment possibilities. While some cytokines, including several haematopoietic factors and interferons, are now used routinely in the clinic, there are still many problems with side effects. These are due to the many different activities of cytokines on different cell populations. In some cases, activities responsible for side effects have been attributed to discreet areas of the proteins and \u201cstructure driven design\u201d can be used to generate novel proteins with better clinical profile. In other cases, structural alterations can enhance activity by increasing serum half-life. This review summarizes the structures of cytokines and their receptor complexes deposited in the Protein Data Base (PDB) and introduces the other articles in this issue on structure-driven design of cytokines for therapy. Cytokines fall into only a few structural classifications. Most of the growth regulatory cytokines including serum factors, growth hormone, haematopoietic growth factors, colony stimulating factors, erythropoietin, IL-3, IL-2 and interferons, are four helix bundles. Factors which primarily induce inflammatory responses, including TNF, lymphotoxin and IL-1, form B-barrel structures that resemble the FGF family. Chemokines and factors that regulate multicellular responses, such as macrophage migration, neutrophil invasion and chemotaxis, have similar structures, classified as \u03b1 +\u03b2. One biological paradox is that many cytokines that vary greatly in function have a similar structure and share receptors. However, homologous cytokines may differ considerably in their mode of interaction with a shared receptor. A few structures for the extracellular regions of cytokine receptors are known, in several cases complexed with their biological target. These structures, coupled with structural alignment of families, indicate areas that control binding to receptors, as opposed to specific areas responsible for the specific activities of this diverse group of proteins.

However, the effects of ImP on endothelial cell (EC) physiology and its role in atherosclerotic coronary artery disease are unknown. Using both human and animal model studies, we investigated the potential contributory role of ImP in the development of atherosclerosis.METHODS:Plasma levels of ImP were measured in patients undergoing elective cardiac angiography (n=831) by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for coronary artery disease were calculated based on the ImP quartiles using both univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. The effects of ImP on functional properties of ECs were assessed using HAECs (human aortic endothelial cells). In a mouse model of carotid artery injury, the impact of ImP on vascular regeneration was examined. Additionally, atheroprone Apoe\u2212/\u2212 mice fed a high-fat diet were treated with and without ImP (800 \u00b5g), and aortic atherosclerotic lesion area was evaluated after 12 weeks. Next-generation sequencing, Western blot analysis, small interfering RNA\u2013based gene knockdown, and tamoxifen-inducible Cre-loxP experiments were performed to investigate ImP-mediated molecular mechanisms.RESULTS:Plasma ImP levels in subjects undergoing cardiac evaluation were associated with increased risk of prevalent coronary artery disease. We found that ImP dose dependently impaired migratory and angiogenic properties of human ECs and promoted an increased inflammatory response. Long-term exposure to ImP compromised the repair potential of the endothelium after an arterial insult. In atheroprone Apoe\u2212/\u2212 (apolipoprotein E\u2212/\u2212) mice, ImP increased atherosclerotic lesion size. Mechanistically, ImP attenuated insulin receptor signaling by suppressing the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT pathway leading to sustained activation of the FOXO1 (forkhead box protein O1) transcription factor. Genetic inactivation of endothelial FOXO1 signaling in ImP-treated mice enhanced the angiogenic activity and preserved the vascular repair capacity of ECs after carotid injury.CONCLUSIONS:Our findings reveal a hitherto unknown role of the microbially produced histidine-derived metabolite ImP in endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, suggesting that ImP metabolism is a potential therapeutic target in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",

We assessed reduction of PTEN protein expression on AKT inhibitor capivasertib efficacy in PIK3CA altered tumors. In PIK3CA altered, PTEN protein high models, PI3K\u03b1 and AKT inhibition was effective, however ablation and partial PTEN expression reduction attenuated PI3K\u03b1i but not AKTi efficacy, alone or combined with fulvestrant. Efficacy was FOXO3 dependent and associated with FOXM1 downregulation. FOXO3A deletion reduced response to capivasertib, and increased FOXM1 expression. Long term capivasertib exposure of ER+\u2009BC cells upregulated FOXM1 expression. Downregulating FOXM1 expression reversed resistance to capivasertib, while FOXM1 overexpression reduced capivasertib efficacy.

    "content": "BackgroundPost-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) has been highly prevalent; over 50% of the patients develop PTS after lower extremity acute deep vein thrombosis. Venoactive compounds (VACs) have been recommended for decades for patients with chronic venous insufficiency, including PTS. The objective of our study was to perform a systematic review to determine the quality of evidence on the utility of VACs for both prevention and treatment of PTS.MethodsA systematic review was conducted to search the literature between January 1, 1980, and July 14, 2023, for venoactive drugs or medications, deep vein thrombosis, and PTS using PubMed, MEDLINE, life science journals, and the Cochrane Library. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English were included in this review. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs were used.ResultsNinety-four references were identified; 11 RCTs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. VACs administered were diosmin, hidrosmin/rutosides, micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF), and sulodexide. The studies included a highly variable proportion of patients with PTS (8.6%-100%). Some older studies omitted details of the methodology. Two studies suggested benefit of diosmin and MPFF as adjunctive treatment to rivaroxaban in the prevention of PTS and showed low or unclear risk of bias. Evaluation of RCTs for the treatment of post-thrombotic chronic venous insufficiency found low or unclear risk of bias in 81.6% to 85.7%. All studies suggested that VACs were beneficial for PTS treatment; they improved venous symptoms, decreased edema, and helped heal venous ulcers.ConclusionsThis systematic review found that VACs had at least moderate quality of evidence in improving venous symptoms, decreasing edema, and accelerating venous ulcer healing. Two pilot RCTs of higher quality suggested the usefulness of diosmin and MPFF as adjunctive treatment to rivaroxaban therapy to reduce the incidence of PTS and improve deep vein recanalization. Because most RCTs were published over two decades ago, and several lacked the required precision in reporting, new high-quality, low-bias RCTs are needed to assess the role of specific VACs for both prevention and treatment of PTS.",

    "content": "Rationale: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) represents the predominant cause of mortality and morbidity globally. Given the established role of hypercholesterolemia as a significant risk factor for ASCVD, the discovery of new lipid-lowering medications is of paramount importance. ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is a crucial enzyme in cellular metabolism, providing acetyl-CoA as the building block for the biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol. Consequently, it has emerged as a promising drug target for innovative treatments of lipid metabolic disorders.Methods: Virtual screening of a natural product library was performed to identify small-molecule ACLY inhibitors, leading to the discovery of isoginkgetin (ISOGK). The lipid-lowering and anti-atherosclerotic effects of ISOGK were validated in hypercholesterolemic diet-induced animal models (mice and hamsters). The inhibitory effects of ISOGK on ACLY enzymatic activity were measured using commercial assay kits. The direct interaction between ISOGK and ACLY was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and cellular thermal shift assays (CETSA). Liver-specific ACLY knockdown mice were generated using GalNAc-conjugated siRNA (GalNAc-siAcly).Results: ISOGK directly bind to ACLY and inhibit its enzymatic activity in vitro and in vivo. By inhibiting ACLY, ISOGK treatment thus alleviates hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis in mice and hamsters. However, ISOGK fails to attenuate lipid accumulation and the expression of lipid-metabolism related genes in Acly knockout or depleted hepatocytes. In vivo, the lipid-lowering and anti-atherosclerotic effects of ISOGK were reversed by hepatic knockdown of Acly via treatment with GalNAc-siAcly in mice.Conclusions: Taken together, the present study identifies ISOGK as an effective and naturally-occurring small-molecule inhibitor of ACLY that limits hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. ISOGK thus serves as a promising drug lead in cardiovascular therapeutics.",

Age-related physiological changes, including ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, increased arterial stiffness, and endothelial dysfunction, are influenced by key mechanisms like autophagy, inflammation, and oxidative stress. This review aims to explore the therapeutic potential of plant-derived bioactive antioxidants in mitigating heart aging. These compounds, often rich in polyphenols, flavonoids, and other phytochemicals, exhibit notable antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cardioprotective properties. These substances have intricate cardioprotective properties, including the ability to scavenge ROS, enhance endogenous antioxidant defenses, regulate signaling pathways, and impede fibrosis and inflammation-promoting processes. By focusing on key molecular mechanisms linked to cardiac aging, antioxidants produced from plants provide significant promise to reduce age-related cardiovascular decline and improve general heart health. Through a comprehensive analysis of preclinical and clinical studies, this work highlights the mechanisms associated with heart aging and the promising effects of plant-derived antioxidants.

However, studies have not exclusively examined the impact of MHO on cardiovascular outcomes in the postmenopausal population.AIMTo explore the prevalence of MHO and its relationship with hospitalization outcomes, including major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (MACCE), in postmenopausal women.METHODSWe extracted data from the National Inpatient Sample 2020 database using International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for all admissions of postmenopausal women. We excluded patients with diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia to obtain metabolically healthy patients and then identified patients with obesity to create obese and non-obese cohorts. We used a 1:1 propensity score matching method to match patients with and without MHO based on age, and then we did a multivariable regression analysis for in-hospital MACCE.RESULTSIn 2020, 1304185 metabolically healthy postmenopausal women were admitted; 148250 (11.4%) had MHO. After propensity score matching for age, a statistically significant difference was observed in overall MACCE [odds ratio (OR): 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.16, P = 0.028] among MHO and non-MHO cohorts, especially in patients of African-American ethnicity (OR: 1.23, 95%CI: 1.01-1.49, P = 0.035) and the lowermost income quartile (OR: 1.24, 95%CI: 1.06-1.44, P = 0.007).CONCLUSIONPostmenopausal patients with MHO are at risk of MACCE, especially black patients and those with lower incomes.

Pediatric-onset T2DM differs from the adult-onset form, particularly regarding the durability of glycemic control and earlier appearance of complications. However, the scarcity of approved treatments and comprehensive studies on T2DM management in youth persists. Ongoing clinical trials seek to ascertain the efficacy and safety of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in patients aged between 10 and 24 years with T2DM. Therefore, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis exploring the efficacy and safety of SGLT2i in pediatric patients and young adults with T2DM.\nMethods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science for randomized controlled clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of SGLT2i in children, adolescents, and young adults with T2DM compared with placebo. Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4 and R statistical software 4.2.1. Heterogeneity was assessed with I2 statistics.\nResults: We included three studies totaling 334 patients followed for 37.79 weeks. Reduction in HbA1C (MD\u2009=\u2009\u22120.93; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009\u22121.36 to \u22120.49; p\u2009 < 0.0001; I2\u2009=\u20090%) was significantly higher in SGLT2i group compared with placebo.

We investigated the serum free interleukin-18 [free state of interleukin-18 (IL-18)] concentration as a prognostic factor for hemodialysis patients' infection risk.MethodsThe Ibaraki Dialysis Initiation Cohort (iDIC) study is a multicenter prospective cohort investigation of patients undergoing a new initiation of dialysis in a local region of Japan. We performed a survival analysis of several events requiring hospitalization and compared the Kaplan\u2013Meier curves of the \u201clow\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d serum free IL-18 concentration groups. To adjust for confounding factors, we also performed a Cox proportional hazards analysis.ResultsWe analyzed the serum free IL-18 concentration of samples from 295 patients randomly selected from the blood sample bank of the iDIC study. The mean free IL-18 concentration was 8.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.3\u00a0pmol/l. The cumulative incidence of infectious events was significantly higher in the low free IL-18 group (<6.0\u00a0pmol/l, log-rank test P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). The Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that low serum free IL-18 (<6.0\u00a0pmol/l) was an independent factor associated with the development of infectious events. Total IL-18 and IL-18BP (binding protein) showed no association with infectious events.ConclusionA low serum free IL-18 concentration in the dialysis initiation period is a potential marker for predicting the development of severe infection in these patients.",

    "content": "Nitro fatty acids (NFAs) are endogenously generated lipid mediators deriving from reactions of unsaturated electrophilic fatty acids with reactive nitrogen species. Furthermore, Mediterranean diets can be a source of NFA. These highly electrophilic fatty acids can undergo Michael addition reaction with cysteine residues, leading to post-translational modifications (PTM) of selected regulatory proteins. Such modifications are capable of changing target protein function during cell signaling or in biosynthetic pathways. NFA target proteins include the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3), the pro-inflammatory and tumorigenic nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway, the pro-inflammatory 5-lipoxygenases (5-LO) biosynthesis pathway as well as soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), which is essentially involved in the regulation of vascular tone. In several animal models of inflammation and cancer, the therapeutic efficacy of well-tolerated NFA has been demonstrated. This has already led to clinical phase II studies investigating possible therapeutic effects of NFA in subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Albeit Michael acceptors feature a broad spectrum of bioactivity, they have for a rather long time been avoided as drug candidates owing to their presumed unselective reactivity and toxicity. However, targeted covalent modification of regulatory proteins by Michael acceptors became recognized as a promising approach to drug discovery with the recent FDA approvals of the cancer therapeutics, afatanib (2013), ibrutinib (2013), and osimertinib (2015). Furthermore, the Michael acceptor, neratinib, a dual inhibitor of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and epidermal growth factor receptor, was recently approved by the FDA (2017) and by the EMA (2018) for the treatment of breast cancer. Finally, a number of further Michael acceptor drug candidates are currently under clinical investigation for pharmacotherapy of inflammation and cancer. In this review, we focus on the pharmacology of NFA and other Michael acceptor drugs, summarizing their potential as an emerging class of future antiphlogistics and adjuvant in tumor therapeutics.",

Moreover, the capacity of the four probiotic species to reduce the concentration of AFM1 was assessed. For this research, 10 raw milk samples were collected randomly in Shiraz, Iran, in January 2023. The analyses were performed using an HPLC system equipped with a fluorescence detector. Then, AFM1 artificially contaminated probiotic drink milk (PDM) containing \nLactobacillus plantarum\n (LP), \nLactobacillus reuteri\n (LRE), \nLactobacillus rhamnosus\n (LR) (LABs) alone or in combination, fermented dairy drink containing \nLactobacillus acidophilus\n (FDD\u2010LA), and yogurt were produced. The pH, total viable number of probiotics (TVNP), and rheology of the samples were measured. In all milk samples, the concentrations of AFM1 did not exceed the maximum threshold established by Iranian national standards. In the artificially spiked samples, the maximal reduction in AFM1 was noted in PDMLP (96.5%), PDMLP\u2010LRE\u2010LR (95.3%), yogurt (95.2%), and PDMLR (93.8%). FDD\u2010LA revealed the lowest reduction in AFM1 (75.9%). The TVNP increased during processing, while the pH decreased in all the samples. AFM1 did not have any negative effect on TVNP or pH. The SEM images revealed that the AFM1\u2010treated samples had a less compact structure and more cavities. Similarly, the viscosity of the control sample without AFM1 was greater than that of the AFM1\u2010supplemented samples. The results showed that LP, LRE, LR, LA, and yogurt starter cultures have a strong ability to decrease AFM1 in milk. However, their effect on the textural properties of the product is not favorable.",

Given the rising concern over antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and considering that E. coli is one of the pathogens with the largest AMR burdens on a global scale, alternative strategies targeting bacterial adhesion are gaining increasing attention. Products that contain D-mannose and cranberry-derived phenolic compounds have shown promise in preventing E. coli colonization and infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the antiadhesive effects of cranberry-related phenolic compounds on FimH-mediated E. coli adhesion using a cellular hemagglutination inhibition assay, as well as to assess the synergistic effects of mannose and phenolic compounds on biofilm formation. Methods: A range of phenolic acids (benzoic, chlorogenic, hippuric, p-coumaric, ferulic and caffeic), resveratrol, (+)-catechin and procyanidin A, as well as a Vaccinium macrocarpon extract, were evaluated for their ability to inhibit FimH-mediated adhesion. A binocular microscope was used to observe agglutination, and we also evaluated the biofilm inhibition potential of the phenolic compounds in the presence of D-mannose. Results: Our results demonstrated that these compounds significantly reduced hemagglutination, with benzoic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and resveratrol exhibiting strong inhibitory effects at concentrations as low as 0.25 mM. Furthermore, the addition of 1 mM solutions of these phenolic compounds to D-mannose resulted in a twofold reduction in the inhibition titer, suggesting synergistic interactions. In addition to their antiadhesive properties, the tested phenolic compounds contributed slightly to the inhibition of FimH-mediated biofilm formation, further supporting their potential roles in UTI prevention. Conclusions: These findings highlight the potential of cranberry-derived phenolics as natural antiadhesive agents against E. coli and warrant further investigation into their mechanisms of action and possible applications in infection control.",

Prediction of carbapenem-resistant infection (CRI) among GN strains is important even before AMS reports are available, for judicious use of empirical antibiotics. We aimed to study the predictors of CRI in patients with HAI.Materials and methodsWe conducted a single-center prospective observational study between April 2023 and September 2024 on patients of GN sepsis with HAI. The use of empirical carbapenem antibiotics, organ dysfunction scores, the modified nutritional risk in critically ill (mNUTRIC) score, blood-count-derived inflammation indices, type of HAI, AMS reports, and in-hospital mortality were noted.ResultsA total of 935 sepsis patients with HAI were screened, and there were 195 patients with GN infection. Among the 195 patients, 145 (74.4%) had CRI and 50 (25.6%) had non-CRI. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay before the day of HAI (p = 0.009, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.155, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.037\u20131.286), presence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (p-value < 0.001, adjusted OR 4.170, 95% CI: 1.858\u20139.361), empirical carbapenem antibiotics before the day of HAI (p-value = 0.004, adjusted OR 3.164, 95% CI: 1.439\u20136.957), and septic shock on the day of HAI (p-value 0.012, adjusted OR 4.162, 95% CI: 1.366\u201312.677) were the independent risk factors of CRI.ConclusionIn GN sepsis patients with HAI, respiratory infection (VAP), length of ICU stay prior to HAI, septic shock, and empirical carbapenem antibiotic administration are risk factors of CRI.How to cite this articleMareguddi AB, Chaudhuri S, Shanmukhappa SM, Parampalli V, Bhatt MT, Fernandes R, et al.

The participants were followed until June 2021. Diagnoses and hospitalization costs were extracted from electronic medical records and the medical insurance system. Disease trajectory networks were constructed by identifying and linking disease pairs with overlapping conditions. Medical expenditures associated with specific diseases were then calculated.ResultsThe study included 30,003 participants with a mean age of 79.6\u2009\u00b1\u200911.1 years, 57.0% of whom were female. After a mean follow-up of 21\u2009\u00b1\u200916 months, 17,428 (58.1%) deaths occurred. The diseases with the highest hazard ratios (HRs) included septic shock (HR 3.59, 95% CI, 3.36\u20133.84), respiratory failure (HR 3.19, 95% CI, 3.05\u20133.34), sepsis (HR 2.98, 95% CI, 2.80\u20133.18), malnutrition (HR 2.38, 95% CI, 2.27\u20132.48), and decubitus ulcer (HR 2.27, 95% CI, 2.14\u20132.41).

Skeletal muscle is the main unit of glucose metabolism, and it is surrounded by extracellular matrix (ECM), which is a microenvironment that acts as an efficient highway system. The ECM is essential for cellular communication and nutrient transport and supports muscle cell growth and repair. When this \u201cECM highway\u201d fails to function effectively because of damage or blockage, the development of T2DMRS can be triggered or exacerbated. In recent years, the ECM has been widely demonstrated to play a critical role in insulin resistance and skeletal muscle regeneration. However, how the remodeling of skeletal muscle ECM components specifically affects the T2DMRS mechanism of action has not been scientifically described in detail. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the T2DMRS-related mechanisms of ECM remodeling, suggesting that collagen and integrins may be potential therapeutic targets.",

Thirty-six participants were randomly assigned to either the Tabata group (four progressive cycles of body-weight high-intensity intermittent training at 75\u201385% of maximum perceived exertion, 3 days/week for 12 weeks) or the control group. Body composition, muscle thickness, strength and endurance, and peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) were measured at baseline and after the training period and compared between groups. No changes in body fat percentage and fat mass were found, but the waist-to-hip ratio was lower in the Tabata group (p = 0.043). The muscle mass percentages of the right (p = 0.026) and left legs (p = 0.043) increased, while the muscle thicknesses of the biceps, triceps, rectus femoris, and vastus intermedius were increased in the Tabata group (p < 0.05) to a greater extent than in the control group (p < 0.05). Muscle strength and endurance (p < 0.05), as well as VO2peak (p = 0.006), also increased in the Tabata group. Twelve weeks of modified Tabata training effectively increased muscle mass and thickness and physical and cardiorespiratory fitness, although it did not reduce fat mass in overweight and obese participants. The combination of this training with a dietary intervention may have a more obvious impact.",

This case-control study recruited participants from health examinations at the Tri-Service General Hospital between March 2015 and October 2019. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and the 12-item short-form survey (SF-12) were used to evaluate the health status and quality of life (QoL) of subjects. Kellgren-Lawrence grading system (KL) was adopted to assess knee radiographs of subjects, KL grade\u2005\u2265\u20052 as KOA patients (KL grade\u2005\u2265\u20053 as severe KOA patients) and KL grade\u2005<\u20052 as controls. Student t-test and \u03c72 test were used to compare the distribution differences between KOA patients and controls, including demographic data, health statuses and QoL. The association of KOA and QoL was determined using multiple regression analysis. There were 772 subjects (young\u2013old, n\u2005=\u2005543; old\u2013old, n\u2005=\u2005229) in this study, 406 KOA patients (including 85 severe KOA patients) and 366 healthy individuals. In the young\u2013old, KOA may play a least role in health status and QoL. However, in the old\u2013old, males with severe KOA would cause a decrease in SF-12 mental component summary score (MCS) (\u03b2= \u221213.75, 95% CI: \u221223.90 to \u22123.61); however, females with severe KOA would cause a decrease in SF-12 physical functioning domain (\u03b2\u2005=\u2005\u221219.44; 95% CI: \u221235.32 to \u22123.56).

The level of serum interleukin 8 (IL-8) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.ResultsThe observation group had a higher clinical control and effectual rate than the control group. After treatment, the improvement of pulmonary function and movement endurance in the observation group was stronger than that in the control group. Meanwhile, the clinical symptoms of COPD were alleviated more in the observation group. Additionally, the decrease in serum IL-8 and MMP-9 levels in the observation group was higher than that in the control group. Finally, the acute exacerbation and rehospitalization of the COPD patient in the observation group was less than that in the control group.ConclusionBYQTC significantly enhances the efficacy of conventional therapy in stable COPD patients, resulting in improvements in clinical symptoms, lung function, and overall quality of life. Notable enhancements were observed in FEV1%, 6MWT distance, and reductions in mMRC and CAT scores.

Photocatalytic therapies play a significant role in the medical field. However, the use of photocatalytic materials in the dental field is relatively limited. In this study, multifunctional titanium dioxide/nanohydroxyapatite (TiO2/HAP) nanocomposites were synthesised using a hydrothermal method and investigated for their antibacterial properties, mineralization-promoting effects, tooth whitening capabilities, and biocompatibility. TiO2 serves as a photocatalyst, facilitating antimicrobial treatment and improving teeth whitening through a photodynamic reaction. HAP, as a mineralization-promoting agent, effectively promotes enamel remineralization following plaque removal. The results of the whitening experiment indicated after treatment by TiO2/HAP combined with blue light irradiation, the tooth color improved from C4 to A1. In a rat molar model of early caries, TiO2/HAP effectively removed dental plaque and increased the calcium-to-phosphorus ratio to 1.58, further validating the results of the microhardness test. Meanwhile, TiO2/HAP nanocomposites demonstrated good biocompatibility in vivo and did not significantly alter the oral microbial community.

Considering there is no specific drug for the management of DPN, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has increasingly drawn attention of clinicians and researchers around the world due to its characteristics of multiple targets, active components, and exemplary safety.ObjectiveTo summarize the current status of TCM in the treatment of DPN and provide directions for novel drug development, the clinical effects and potential mechanisms of TCM used in treating DPN were comprehensively reviewed.MethodsExisting evidence on TCM interventions for DPN was screened from databases such as PubMed, the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (CENTRAL), and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI). The focus was on summarizing and analyzing representative preclinical and clinical TCM studies published before 2023.ResultsThis review identified the ameliorative effects of about 22 single herbal extracts, more than 30 herbal compound prescriptions, and four Chinese patent medicines on DPN in preclinical and clinical research. The latest advances in the mechanism highlight that TCM exerts its beneficial effects on DPN by inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum stress and improving mitochondrial function.ConclusionsTCM has shown the power latent capacity in treating DPN. It is proposed that more large-scale and multi-center randomized controlled clinical trials and fundamental experiments should be conducted to further verify these findings.",

It can counteract inflammatory constituents at multiple levels by hampering pro-inflammatory factor release, alleviating inflammatory propagation, and attenuating tissue injury. It concurrently modulates oxidative stress by the blockage of the detrimental Nrf2 pathway when autophagy is impaired. Therefore, it exerts diverse therapeutic effects on a variety of pathological conditions associated with chronic metabolic diseases and age-related disorders. It shows multidimensional effects, including neuroprotection from neurodegenerative disorders and diabetic peripheral neuropathy, neuromodulation, mitigation of cardiovascular disorders, skin diseases, diabetic mellitus, liver and kidney injuries, and anti-pathogen and anti-tumor activities.

In the present study, streptozotocin-induced diabetes exhibited notable decrease in the levels of phospholipids, glycolipids, gangliosides, and triglycerides in the sciatic nerve. The alterations in lipids resulted in increase in cholesterol to phospholipid ratio in sciatic nerve of diabetic animals. This ratio is crucial and determines the rheological properties of membranes and resulted in substantial reduction in the activity of membrane-bound enzymes; Ca2\u202f+ ATPase and acetylcholinesterase. Histological examination of the cross-section of the sciatic nerve in diabetic mice revealed axonal atrophy and disarrayed myelin sheath. The potential therapeutic impact of N-acetyl Cysteine (NAC), a powerful antioxidant, on a rat model of diabetic neuropathy was evaluated. NAC was administered to rats in drinking water for a period of 8 weeks. The results indicate that administration of NAC restored lipid composition; ratio of cholesterol to phospholipids, the activity of membrane linked enzymes, and improved the structural defects in sciatic nerve. NAC plays protective role against diabetes-induced alterations in lipid composition in sciatic nerve membranes leading to improvement in structure and function of membranes. Overall, the findings suggest NAC as a potential therapeutic strategy in preventing diabetic neuropathy and other diabetic complications.",

Sodium alginate (SA), a natural polysaccharide from brown algae, has demonstrated health benefits, however, whether it can treat streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DPN remains unclear. The present experiment aimed to test the preventive role of SA on STZ-induced DPN in rats and explored the possible mechanisms. The DPN rat model was established in rats by intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of 40 mg/kg b.w. STZ, and SA (200 mg/kg b.w./day) was orally administered for 28 days after type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) induction. The obtained findings revealed that STZ significantly increased serum levels of FBG, HOMA-IR, TC, TG, VLDL-C, and LDL-C, while decreased serum insulin, incretin GLP-1, HDL-C, and lipase activity. In the sciatic nerves, STZ significantly increased proinflammatory cytokine levels (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1), caspase-3 (a pro-apoptotic protein), markers of oxidative stress (MDA and NO), and AGEs. In parallel, STZ induced a significant decline in the activities of enzymatic antioxidants, viz., SOD, CAT, and GPx, and non-enzymatic GSH. These changes were accompanied by a low expression of miR-146a in the sciatic nerves of DPN rats. Except for HOMA-IR, SA treatment to STZ injected rats significantly improved these parameters and helped to rescue the neurological morphology of the sciatic nerve fibers. In conclusion, SA mitigated experimental DPN, and this might be due to its ability to suppress hyperglycemic-hyperlipidemic effects, counteract the overactivation of inflammatory molecules, increase miR-146a expression, modulate oxidative dysregulation, and reduce cell apoptosis.",

Materials and Methods: Patients with Non-DM (n = 62), Pre-DM (n = 97), and DM (n = 327) were included in the study, and laboratory parameters suitable for routine use were analyzed retrospectively. Various inflammatory markers, lipid profiles, and metabolic indicators were evaluated. Results: In prediabetic patients, PNP severity showed a significant positive correlation with age (p < 0.001) and glucose levels (p = 0.020) and a significant negative correlation with LDL levels (p = 0.009). In diabetic patients, there was a positive correlation between PNP severity and age (p < 0.001), neutrophils (p = 0.024), triglycerides (p = 0.012), glucose (p < 0.001), HbA1c (p < 0.001), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p = 0.001), glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) (p < 0.001), triglyceride/HDL ratio (TG/HDL) (p < 0.001), TyG index (p < 0.001), and a significant negative correlation with platelet (PLT) (p < 0.001), HDL (p < 0.001), and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) (p < 0.001). In addition, age (p < 0.001), GLR (p = 0.027), and TG/HDL (p < 0.001) values were positively correlated, and the TG/glucose ratio (TGR) (p = 0.018) was negatively correlated with PNP severity in Pre-DM and DM patients. Conclusions: Our study suggests that inflammatory markers and lipid indices may play an important role in determining the severity of DNP in Non-DM, Pre-DM, and DM patients. These parameters may offer a new, easy, and low-cost option for assessing the risk of diabetic polyneuropathy.",

Male rats were grouped into aged and young according to age. The young rats were considered as normal control (NC) and treated with saline. Aged were further divided into 2 groups and treated with intracavernous (IC) PRP and saline. Treatment was scheduled at the 9th and 10th week for NC and 41th and 42th week for aged\u2010ED rats, with EF analysis scheduled on the 12th week for NC and 44th week for aged\u2010ED rats, respectively. Erectile response, immunofluorescence staining, and electron microscopic analyses were performed. IC PRP treatment effectively reduced prostate hyperplasia\u00a0(PH). EF response indicated a significant increase in crucial EF parameters in PRP\u2010treated aged\u2010ED rats. Histological evidence denoted a rigid and restored development of tunica adventitia of the dorsal artery, decreased vacuolation of the dorsal penile nerve, and structural expansion of the epineurium.

Given its multifactorial pathogenesis, bioactive compounds such as vitamin D, melatonin, and omega-3 fatty acids have emerged as potential adjuncts to periodontal therapy due to their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative properties. This narrative review explores the role of these three supplements in periodontal health, their potential in synergistic effects, and existing research gaps, providing a foundation for future studies on their clinical applications. Vitamin D is essential for calcium homeostasis, bone remodeling, and immune function. It modulates both innate and adaptive immune responses, enhancing antimicrobial peptide production and reducing inflammatory cytokine expression. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids while promoting the synthesis of pro-resolving lipid mediators, contributing to bone preservation and immune balance. Melatonin, known for its antioxidant and osteogenic properties, supports bone remodeling by stimulating osteoblast proliferation and inhibiting osteoclast activity, while also regulating circadian rhythms, which may influence oral health. Although these bioactive compounds show promising effects in preclinical and clinical studies, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding optimal dosages, long-term efficacy, combined use, and standardized treatment protocols. Further clinical trials are necessary to elucidate their therapeutic value in periodontal disease management, especially those focused on their potential synergistic mechanisms. Understanding their synergistic mechanisms may open new avenues for adjunctive strategies in periodontal therapy.",

Notably, premature aging as well as the emergence of progeroid syndromes have posed concerns regarding chronic health conditions and comorbidities in the aging population. Accelerated telomere attrition is also implicated in metabolic dysfunction and the development of metabolic disorders. Impaired metabolic homeostasis arises secondary to age-related increases in the synthesis of free radicals, decreased oxidative capacity, impaired antioxidant defense, and disrupted energy metabolism. In particular, several cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging have been identified to decipher the influence of premature aging on metabolic diseases. These include defective DNA repair, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, and dysregulation of nutrient-sensing pathways. The role of telomere attrition premature aging in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases has been largely attributed to pro-inflammatory states that promote telomere shortening, genetic mutations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase, epigenetic alteration, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunctions. Nonetheless, the therapeutic interventions focus on restoring the length of telomeres and may include treatment approaches to restore telomerase enzyme activity, promote alternative lengthening of telomeres, counter oxidative stress, and decrease the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Given the significance and robust potential of delaying telomere attrition in age-related metabolic diseases, this review aimed to explore the molecular and cellular mechanisms of aging underlying premature telomere attrition and metabolic diseases, assimilating evidence from both human and animal studies.",

Brain function was assessed using a verbal fluency task (VFT). Resting-state and task-state cortical activations were investigated to determine differences between AD and LBD. Blood samples were analyzed to identify relevant biomarkers. The clinical and HbO variables were compared between AD and LBD. Functional connectivity at rest and correlations between HbO variables and blood biomarkers were analyzed. The sensitivity and specificity of the parameters for differentiating the dementias were evaluated using areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs).ResultsThis study recruited 28 inpatients with AD and 25 with LBD. Mean HbO concentrations did not significantly differ in the resting state (p > 0.05), whereas functional connectivity significantly differed (t = \u22123.449, p = 0.001) between the groups. Mean HbO concentrations during the VFT, were significantly lower in the left temporal (p = 0.031), right dorsolateral prefrontal (p = 0.001), and right temporal (p = 0.011) cortices of the AD, than the LBD group. Blood amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2)42 levels were significantly higher in the AD group (p = 0.023), whereas significantly more \u03b1-synuclein was expressed in the LBD group (p = 0.012).

In nature, H. erinaceus grows on old or dead tree trunks, and P. eryngii grows on Apiaceae plant roots, whereas in cultivation, they grow on substrates mainly consisting of dry wood chips, straw, and cereals. To make their farming more sustainable, supplements such as olive mill solid waste (OMSW) have been added to support mushroom development. However, so far, the impact of substrate additives on the edible mushroom metabolic content has not been assessed.MethodsHere, we examined the effect of different proportions of OMSW added to the substrate on the metabolic profiles of the fruiting body (FB) and mycelium of H. erinaceus and P. eryngii mushrooms. The study includes four groups for each mushroom species, mushrooms are grown on 0% OMSW, 33%, 60%, and 80% OMSW, with three biological repeats in each group. We used computational metabolomics strategies including GNPS molecular networking, MS2Query, and the FERMO dashboard, to organize, annotate, and prioritize metabolite features from the untargeted Q-Exactive Plus HR-LC-MS/MS metabolomics data. Following chromatography-based fractionation, the metabolite annotation of four metabolite features was further validated or fine-tuned using 1H-NMR, to resolve structural isomers.Results and discussionOur computational metabolomics strategies showed several annotated metabolite features to be affected by OSMW concentration. In general, the methanolic extracts of H. erinaceus FB and mycelium were more highly enriched with specialized metabolites than those of P. eryngii. Interestingly, OMSW increased several hericenone analogues in the H. erinaceus FB, as well as several erinacerin metabolites from the mycelium. In addition, high concentrations of OMSW decreased the enniatin metabolite abundance. In conclusion, we demonstrate how a change in substrate composition affects the mushroom\u2019s specialized metabolome and can induce and alter mushroom metabolite content and diversity. These results highlight the importance of including computational metabolomic strategies to investigate new sustainable growth options for edible mushrooms and other natural foods.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11306-025-02257-9.",

    "content": "Background: The ketogenic diet (KD) is becoming a popular nutritional model for athletes. One limitation of this diet is the use of animal-meat products, which may be unacceptable to some people. Moreover, the relationship between this diet\u2019s use, body composition, and strength capacity has not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to assess the effects of a two-week fish-based restrictive KD on body composition, strength capacity (isometric muscle strength), and somatic disorders in healthy adults. Methods: Participants were recruited through advertisements, posters displayed at the university, and information shared among colleagues. Ultimately, 14 individuals qualified for this study. For two weeks, they followed a designated ketogenic diet enriched with fish and omega-3 fatty acids, with a calorie reduction of \u2212500 kcal/day. The study was designed and conducted as a single-group pre\u2013post study. Before and after completing the diet, participants\u2019 body composition (body mass, body fat, fat-free mass, and visceral fat) and strength capacity (knee extensor peak torque [KEPT] and knee flexor peak torque [KFPT]) were measured. The survey also analyzed participants\u2019 somatic disorders such as nausea, vomiting, energy level, diarrhea, constipation, drowsiness, sleep problems, hunger, thirst, and bad breath. The average results of both trials obtained before and after the diet were compared using the paired Student\u2019s t-test or non-parametric test. The significance level was set at 0.05. Results: After two weeks of a fish-based restrictive KD, significant increases in ketone bodies were observed in both the blood (pre: 0.21 mmol/L \u00b1 0.15 vs. post: 2.20 \u00b1 1.19, p < 0.001) and urine (pre: 0.00 mmol/L \u00b1 0.00 vs. post: 4.64 mmol/L \u00b1 3.24, p < 0.001). Body composition changes included significant reductions in total body mass (pre: 76.66 kg \u00b1 11.06 vs. post: 73.77 kg \u00b1 10.76, p < 0.001), fat mass (pre: 21.34 kg \u00b1 7.36 vs. post: 19.73 kg \u00b1 7.20, p < 0.001), and visceral fat (pre: 708.50 g \u00b1 627.67 vs. post: 603.21 g \u00b1 567.82, p = 0.0012). Skeletal muscle mass decreased by 2% (pre: 27.75 kg \u00b1 5.80 vs. post: 27.03 kg \u00b1 5.47, p = 0.01), though no significant changes were seen in muscle strength when adjusting for body mass or skeletal muscle mass. No major adverse effects were noted in relation to somatic disorders, although some participants reported increased thirst and bad breath. Conclusions: After 14 days of a fish-based restrictive KD, a significant reduction in body mass and changes in body composition were observed, with no loss of muscle strength. This type of diet may serve as an effective method for rapid body mass reduction in sports with weight categories, while preserving muscle strength, which is crucial for athletes. It could also be an alternative means for individuals to eliminate animal meat from their diet.",

    "content": "ObjectivePatients with esophageal cancer who undergo esophagectomy are at high risk for malnutrition. Jejunostomy tubes are often placed to provide enteral access for nutritional support. Traditionally, jejunostomy placement occurs at the time of esophagectomy. However, benefits have been described in patients with earlier jejunostomy placement. The purpose of this study is to determine outcomes of surgical patients with esophageal cancer on the basis of jejunostomy tube placement as well as to analyze the effect of placement timing on these factors.MethodsThis is a retrospective, multi-institutional study including 2 academic hospital systems. Patients with esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy were included. Patients who received a jejunostomy tube were compared with patients who did not receive a jejunostomy tube. Further analysis comparing early and routine jejunostomy placement timing was then performed.ResultsOf 327 included patients, 48.32% (158) had a jejunostomy tube and 51.68% (169) did not have any form of enteral access. For every day a patient had a jejunostomy tube in place, there was a reduction in hospital length of stay (LOS) and intensive care unit LOS (P \u2264 .001 and\u00a0<\u00a0.001).ConclusionsJejunostomy tube placement in patients with esophageal cancer undergoing esophagectomy significantly enhances nutritional outcomes, particularly in malnourished patients, and reduces 90-day mortality and recurrence rates. Patients with esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy and received an early jejunostomy tube had shorter hospital and intensive care unit LOS. Early placement of jejunostomy tubes should be considered to optimize nutritional support and improve overall patient resilience before surgery. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings and refine guidelines for jejunostomy tube placement in patients with esophageal cancer.",

    "content": "Background:Obesity is a complex, chronic, stigmatized disease whereby abnormal or excess body fat may impair health or increase the risk of medical complications, and can reduce quality of life and shorten lifespan in children and families. We developed this guideline to provide evidence-based recommendations on options for managing pediatric obesity that support shared decision-making among children living with obesity, their families, and their health care providers.Methods:We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We used the Guidelines International Network principles to manage competing interests. Caregivers, health care providers, and people living with obesity participated throughout the guideline development process, which optimized relevance. We surveyed end users (caregivers, health care providers) to prioritize health outcomes, completed 3 scoping reviews (2 on minimal important difference estimates; 1 on clinical assessment), performed 1 systematic review to characterize families\u2019 values and preferences, and conducted 3 systematic reviews and meta-analyses to examine the benefits and harms of behavioural and psychological, pharmacologic, and surgical interventions for managing obesity in children. Guideline panellists developed recommendations focused on an individualized approach to care by using the GRADE evidence-to-decision framework, incorporating values and preferences of children living with obesity and their caregivers.Recommendations:Our guideline includes 10 recommendations and 9 good practice statements for managing obesity in children. Managing pediatric obesity should be guided by a comprehensive child and family assessment based on our good practice statements. Behavioural and psychological interventions, particularly multicomponent interventions (strong recommendation, very low to moderate certainty), should form the foundation of care, with tailored therapy and support using shared decision-making based on the potential benefits, harms, certainty of evidence, and values and preferences of children and families. Pharmacologic and surgical interventions should be considered (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty) as therapeutic options based on availability, feasibility, and acceptability, and guided by shared decision-making between health care providers and families.Interpretation:This guideline will support children, families, and health care providers to have informed discussions about the balance of benefits and harms for available obesity management interventions to support value- and preference-sensitive decision-making.",

    "content": "In temperate regions, boars experience environmental heat stress due to the subtropical climate, leading to their semen quality and fertility being severely compromised compared to indigenous breeds. Considering the above effect, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of season on semen quality, seminal plasma antioxidant status, and in vivo fertility of crossbred boars of exotic (50%) and indigenous inheritance in a subtropical climate. A total of 14 Hampshire\u2013Ghungroo crossbred boars were used for this investigation, which took place in both summer and winter. Sperm characteristics, namely motility, viability, abnormality, acrosomal integrity, and the hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST) results, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were evaluated. Sperm kinematics parameters were assessed using computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA). Antioxidant biomarkers (glutathione peroxidase, GPx; catalase, CAT; and total antioxidant capacity, TAC) and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde, MDA) were analyzed in boars\u2019 seminal plasma. The summer season had a significant (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) negative impact on reaction time and false mounts, whereas semen volume and sperm concentration were significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) higher in the winter season. Similarly, sperm abnormalities were significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) lower in the winter season. In the winter, sperm quality parameters, namely total motility, progressive motility, viability, acrosomal integrity, and HOST reactivity, were significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) improved. However, during the summer, sperm MMP was significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) lower in fresh samples and after 72\u202fh of storage. Season had a significant (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) effect on the following sperm kinematics parameters: average path velocity, straight-line velocity, curve linear velocity, amplitude of lateral head displacement, and beat cross frequency. Semen characteristics were significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) improved in winter after 72\u202fh of cold storage compared with those in summer. The summer season had a significant effect (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) on seminal plasma antioxidant biomarkers (TAC, MDA, CAT, and GPx). Furthermore, the farrowing rate was significantly (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) higher in the winter season. In conclusion, our results showed that the low MMP of boar sperm and the downregulation of seminal plasma antioxidant biomarkers in summer lead to poor semen quality and poor fertility in Hampshire\u2013Ghungroo crossbred boars in a subtropical climate. To alleviate the heat-stress-induced poor sperm fertility in boars and to optimize the fertility of boars during summer in subtropics, there is a need for scientific interventions in terms of genetics [less exotic inheritance (below 50%)], nutrition, and management.",

These effects are primarily attributed to catechins contained in green tea leaves, particularly epigallocatechin-3-gallate. However, in humans, the realization of green tea\u2019s beneficial effects is limited. In order to summarize and critically analyze the available scientific information about green tea\u2019s health benefits and issues related to its use, we conducted an in-depth literature review in scientific databases. A number of in vitro studies reported that green tea catechins modulate various signaling pathways in cells, which is thought to underlie their beneficial effects. However, data on the effects of catechins in humans are scarce, which is partly due to their low stability and oral bioavailability. Furthermore, catechins may also participate in pharmacokinetic interactions when co-administered with certain drugs such as anticancer agents, drugs for cardiovascular diseases, immunosuppressors, etc. As a result, adverse drug reactions or therapy failure may occur. In conclusion, over the years, various approaches have been investigated to optimize catechin intake and to achieve beneficial effects in humans, but to date, the use of catechins for prophylaxis or disease treatment remains limited. Therefore, future studies regarding the possibilities of catechins administration are needed.",

    "content": "BackgroundChronic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction are key features of systemic aging, closely associated with the development and progression of age-related metabolic diseases. Bazi Bushen (BZBS), a traditional Chinese medicine used to alleviate frailty, delays biological aging by modulating DNA methylation levels. However, the precise mechanism of its anti-aging effect remains unclear. In this study, we developed the Energy Expenditure Aging Index (EEAI) to estimate biological age. By integrating the EEAI with transcriptome analysis, we aimed to explore the impact of BZBS on age-related metabolic dysregulation and inflammation in naturally aging mice.MethodsWe conducted indirect calorimetry analysis on five groups of mice with different ages and utilized the data to construct EEAI. 12 -month-old C57BL/6\u00a0J mice were treated with BZBS or \u03b2-Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) for 8\u00a0months. Micro-CT, Oil Red O staining, indirect calorimetry, RNA sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and qRT-PCR were performed to investigate the regulatory effects of BZBS on energy metabolism, glycolipid metabolism, and inflammaging.ResultsThe results revealed that BZBS treatment effectively reversed the age-related decline in energy expenditure and enhanced overall metabolism, as indicated by the aging index of energy expenditure derived from energy metabolism parameters across various ages. Subsequent investigations showed that BZBS reduced age-induced visceral fat accumulation and hepatic lipid droplet aggregation. Transcriptomic analysis of perirenal fat and liver indicated that BZBS effectively enhanced lipid metabolism pathways, such as the PPAR signaling pathway, fatty acid oxidation, and cholesterol metabolism, and improved glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Additionally, there was a significant improvement in inhibiting the inflammation-related arachidonic acid-linoleic acid metabolism pathway and restraining the IL-17 and TNF inflammatory pathways activated via senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP).ConclusionsBZBS has the potential to alleviate inflammation in metabolic organs of naturally aged mice and maintain metabolic homeostasis.

The procedure involved the application of ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) in combination with deep eutectic solvents (DESs). Eleven different DESs and three conventional solvents were employed as extraction media for polyphenolic compounds. Choline chloride\u2013citric acid (ChCl-CA) was selected as the most suitable extractant, considering its extraction efficiency in relation to the total phenolic content. The operating conditions of UAE were optimized and modeled by the use of response surface methodology in order to maximize the yield of total phenolics and antioxidant capacity. The optimal operational parameters for the UAE procedure were determined to be 16.5 min, 74% (v/v) DES in water, and a solvent-to-solid ratio equal to 192. HPLC analysis, which was performed on the optimum extract, revealed significant levels of phenolics present in the aloe rind. Efficient recovery of the extracted antioxidants was obtained by the use of solid-phase extraction (SPE) and polyamide cartridges. The ChCl-CA DES exhibited excellent recycling capability with a yield of over 90% through SPE. Finally, the greenness of the method was evaluated using the green AGREE and AGREEprep metrics.

This study aims to investigate trends in macronutrient intake correlations over a 9-year period among different familial pairs, including parent-offspring, siblings, and spouses, using data from the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS).MethodsThis longitudinal study, conducted within the framework of the TLGS, analyzed data from 1,814 families over a 9-year period. Dietary intakes were assessed using a validated 168-item food frequency questionnaire. Macronutrient intakes were calculated and adjusted for age. Familial correlations were estimated using intraclass correlation coefficients for various familial pairs (parent-offspring, siblings, and spouses) across four consecutive surveys. Changes in correlations were analyzed over 3-year, 6-year, and 9-year intervals, as well as across all four surveys, to determine overall trends in macronutrient intake correlations.ResultsThe results revealed diverse trends in intake correlations for carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and specific fatty acids across familial relationships. Parent-offspring dyads exhibited varied patterns, with some nutrients showing regression to the mean. Sister-sister pairs demonstrated strengthening correlations for energy, carbohydrates, fats, and saturated fatty acids over time. Conversely, brother-sister pairs displayed weakening correlations for most macronutrients, particularly energy, proteins, cholesterol, and fiber. Spouse correlations tended towards regression to the mean for energy, carbohydrates, and fats, and fiber.ConclusionsThe present study illuminates the dynamic nature of familial dietary correlations over time. The contrasting trends between sister-sister and brother-sister dyads suggest a significant influence of gender on shared dietary patterns. These findings underscore the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors in shaping family dietary behaviors and highlight the importance of considering both gender and relationship type when examining familial nutritional habits.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12889-024-20362-7.",

This included 70 questions on sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, dietary habits, including key Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) foods. A total of 945 Spanish adults from 1268 European that completed the online survey were included in the analysis.\n\n\nResults\nMost of the Spanish participants adopted healthier dietary habits during home lockdown, which was translated to a higher MedDiet adherence. However, a negative impact on physical activity levels, sleep quality or smoking rates was observed. Low MedDiet adherence was associated with a higher risk of weight gain (OR\u2009=\u20091.53, CI 1.1\u20132.1; p\u2009=\u20090.016), while no snacking between meals reduced the risk by 80% (OR\u2009=\u20090.20, CI 0.09\u20130.45, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and eating more quantity, considering portion size, increased body weight gain risk almost sixfold more.\n\n\nConclusion\nTo conclude, although dietary habits were improved during home lockdown, certain unhealthy behaviours (e.g. increased snacking between meals, increased food intake, and an increase in sedentary behaviour) were increased.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00394-022-02814-1.",

A detailed FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) developed by NOVA-UPF Screener with 33 ultra-processed food items was used to evaluate the consumption patterns of UPF.ResultsMost of the participants with diabetes have a habit of eating breakfast daily (68%), prefer lunch from home (72%), and about 20% avoid eating at a restaurant. While only 45.7% of the participants without diabetes have breakfast daily, and 88.4% prefer to eat lunch outside rather than homemade food. Comparative analysis shows that all 33 UPFs were consumed significantly less by individuals with diabetes than those without diabetes (p < 0.001).ConclusionThe reduced intake of UPFs highlights greater dietary caution among individuals with T2D.

    "content": "Bone and joint diseases are debilitating conditions that can result in significant functional impairment or even permanent disability. Multiscale metal-based nanocomposites, which integrate hierarchical structures ranging from the nanoscale to the macroscale, have emerged as a promising solution to this challenge. These materials combine the unique properties of metal-based nanoparticles (MNPs), such as enzyme-like activities, stimuli responsiveness, and photothermal conversion, with advanced manufacturing techniques, such as 3D printing and biohybrid systems. The integration of MNPs within polymer or ceramic matrices offers a degree of control over the mechanical strength, antimicrobial efficacy, and the manner of drug delivery, whilst concomitantly promoting the processes of osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. This review highlights breakthroughs in stimulus-responsive MNPs (e.g., photo-, magnetically-, or pH-activated systems) for on-demand therapy and their integration with biocomposite hybrids containing cells or extracellular vesicles to mimic the native tissue microenvironment. The applications of these composites are extensive, ranging from bone defects, infections, tumors, to degenerative joint diseases. The review emphasizes the enhanced load-bearing capacity, bioactivity, and tissue integration that can be achieved through hierarchical designs. Notwithstanding the potential of these applications, significant barriers to progress persist, including challenges related to long-term biocompatibility, regulatory hurdles, and scalable manufacturing. Finally, we propose future directions, including machine learning-guided design and patient-specific biomanufacturing to accelerate clinical translation. Multiscale metal-based nanocomposites, which bridge nanoscale innovations with macroscale functionality, are a revolutionary force in the field of biomedical engineering, providing personalized regenerative solutions for bone and joint diseases.",

    "content": "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic disease which clinically presents with symptoms related to esophageal dysfunction, while pathologically it is characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of esophageal epithelium. Most patients with EoE present with food and/or inhalant allergy symptoms. The results of animal model studies and genetic studies, as well as the efficacy of elimination diets in managing the symptoms, suggest an atopic background of the disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of EoE in a group of patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms and food and/or inhalant allergies and to assess the influence of drugs used in type I allergies on the results of endoscopic, histopathological, and immunohistochemical tests. Methods: This was a prospective observational study. Patients with inhalant/food allergies and upper esophageal symptoms constituted the study group while patients without allergies who were diagnosed with dyspepsia or irritable bowel syndrome constituted the control group. All study group subjects underwent allergy testing, including prick testing and blood tests. All participants underwent a gastroscopy with specimen collection. Esophageal specimens were stained for eotaxin-1 and desmoglein-1. Results: Based on histopathology results, eosinophilic esophagitis was found in 9 of the 73 patients from the study group. All patients with EoE presented with multimorbidity and were diagnosed with at least one allergic disease in addition to EoE. Positive staining for CCL-11 was found in 56 (78%) patients in the study group, including all patients with EoE while only 3 (17%) individuals from the control group showed positive staining. The presence of DSG-1 in esophageal specimens was detected in 6 (7%) subjects from the study group in contrast to 14 (78%) subjects from the control group. DSG-1 was not found in any of the specimens of patients diagnosed with EoE. Conclusions: EoE is a rare disease, usually accompanied by allergic multimorbidity. Positive staining for eotaxin-1 and negative staining for desmoglein-1 in patients with esophageal symptoms and allergies but who did not meet EoE diagnostic criteria could be indicative of subclinical course of the disease or a masking effect of corticosteroids. It is now vitally important for both researchers and practicing clinicians to recognize that eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is not a homogeneous disease but rather consists of multiple subtypes (phenotypes). The so-called \u201cclassic\u201d form of EoE\u2014defined by current diagnostic criteria as the presence of more than 15 eosinophils per high power field on histopathological examination\u2014appears to represent only the tip of the iceberg. There is an urgent need for further research in order to refine endoscopic techniques, expand the scope of histopathological assessments, and identify novel biomarkers to better define the distinct phenotypes of eosinophilic esophagitis.",

It is characterized by adverse reactions to dietary substances, potentially triggered by various mechanisms. Food allergy, a subset of food hypersensitivity, denotes an immune response to food proteins categorized into immunoglobulin IgE-mediated or non-IgE-mediated reactions. Conversely, food intolerance, another facet of food hypersensitivity, refers to non-immunological reactions, in which the human body cannot properly digest certain foods or components, leading to gastrointestinal discomfort and other non-immune-related symptoms. The main objective of this study was to determine and differentiate the differences, characteristics, and types of food hypersensitivity. Methods: This study involved a comprehensive review of key research from 1990 onward, including review articles, prospective studies, nested case\u2013control studies, and meta-analyses. Results: Recognizing these differences is essential for healthcare professionals to ensure accurate diagnosis, effective management, and improved patient outcomes, while also aiding dietitians in providing optimal nutritional and dietary guidance.

The clinical frailty score (CFS) facilitates rapid assessment, aiding prognostication, care improvement, and resource allocation, particularly in resource-limited intensive care units (ICUs).Materials and methodsA prospective observational cohort study was conducted from April to September 2023 at a tertiary care ICU. The study included 166 patients aged \u226550 years with ICU stays longer than 48 hours, excluding those with contraindications for care escalation. Data were collected on demographics, Clinical parameters, and scoring systems including acute physiological and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE-II), sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), and CFS. Predictive analyses were performed using receiver operating curve (ROC) curves, cut-offs, and logistic regression.ResultsThe median age of patients was 65 years, with an APACHE-II score of 18 and a CFS of 4. In-hospital mortality was 46.4%. The CFS outperformed other scoring systems in predicting both in-hospital mortality [Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) 0.73] and net negative outcomes (AUC ROC 0.75). Frailty (CFS \u22656) was present in 39.75% of patients, with each unit increase in CFS associated with a 41.8% higher odds of mortality and a 50.7% higher odds of net negative outcomes. The optimal CFS cut-offs were 4 for 80% sensitivity and 6 for 80% specificity.ConclusionThe CFS is a practical and reliable tool for predicting ICU outcomes, outperforming traditional scoring systems. It supports improved decision-making and resource allocation. Further multicenter studies are necessary to validate its broader use in critical care practice.How to cite this articleSaxena S, Gupta P, Panwar P, Jain A, Jain SS, Jain R, et al.

    "content": "IntroductionIron deficiency anaemia (IDA) accounts for nearly two-thirds of all anaemia cases globally. Despite the widespread use of iron supplementation, the optimal dose and duration for treating IDA remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the most effective dose and duration of iron supplementation for improving haemoglobin (Hb) levels in children and adolescents (\u226419 years) with IDA.MethodsA systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library for peer-reviewed studies published between 2013 and 2024. The interventions included iron supplementation with a defined dose and duration of at least 30 days. Comparators were placebo, no treatment, or alternative regimens. The outcome was the change in Hb levels. Eligible studies included IDA cases diagnosed through ferritin level measurements in healthy individuals. Studies involving pregnant women or children with underlying conditions were excluded. A meta-analysis was performed using standardized mean differences to pool effect sizes for Hb improvement with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses were performed for different treatment durations (<3 months, 3\u20136 months, >6 months) and dosage categories (<5 mg/kg/day, 5\u201310 mg/kg/day, >10 mg/kg/day). A random-effects meta-regression model was used to determine the optimal dose and duration, accounting for known covariates affecting Hb improvement.ResultsA total of 28 studies with 8,829 participants from 16 countries were included. The pooled effect size for Hb improvement was 2.01 gm/dL (95% CI: 1.48\u20132.54, p < 0.001). Iron supplementation for less than 3 months showed the highest significant effect size (2.39 gm/dL, 95% CI: 0.72\u20134.07), followed by treatments exceeding 6 months (1.93 gm/dL, 95% CI: 0.09\u20133.77). The lowest effect size was observed in treatments lasting 3\u20136 months (1.58 gm/dL, 95% CI: 0.93\u20132.23). Low-dose iron supplementation (<5 mg/kg/day) demonstrated favourable trends in Hb improvement, particularly in individuals with lower baseline Hb levels. Oral ferrous sulphate had a significant effect (2.03 gm/dL, 95% CI: 1.24\u20132.82), while parenteral ferric Carboxymaltose showed consistent efficacy.ConclusionLow-dose iron supplementation (<5 mg/kg/day) combined with treatment durations of either less than 3 months or more than 6 months, is optimal for improving Hb levels in children and adolescents with IDA. Tailoring treatment based on baseline Hb levels and anaemia severity is essential. These findings provide evidence to support updated guidelines on iron supplementation in paediatric and adolescent populations and inform national anaemia management programmes.Trial registrationProspero registration number: This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024541773).",

Dysphagia leads to impaired quality of life in the short- and long-term postoperative period and affects patient prognosis. The reasons for the occurrence of dysphagia have been controversial, for which we provide new insights. We compared the effects of different jejunal positions on the incidence of postoperative dysphagia in patients with gastric cancer.MethodsA total of 116 patients who underwent radical total gastrectomy and esophagojejunostomy for gastric cancer were included. The patients were divided into 2 groups: right esophagojejunostomy (REJ) and left esophagojejunostomy (LEJ). Clinical and pathologic characteristics, incidence of postoperative dysphagia and other surgical complications were compared between the two groups.ResultsAfter grouping the patients, there were 60 patients in the REJ group and 56 patients in the LEJ group. The incidence of postoperative dysphagia was higher in the REJ group than in the LEJ group (p\u2009=\u20090.035) 17 (28.3%) and 7 (12.5%) respectively. Anastomotic stenosis occurred in one patient in the REJ group, and displacement of the jejunum occurred in six patients after imaging, and two of them underwent secondary surgical treatment to severe dysphagia, which was not found in the LEJ group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that LEJ was an independent protective factor for dysphagia and anastomotic fistula was an independent risk factor for dysphagia (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The jejunal position had the greatest impact on dysphagia.ConclusionsLEJ can effectively reduce the incidence of dysphagia in gastric cancer patients after esophagojejunostomy.

The continued lack of understanding of the various subtypes of MCI impedes the implementation of effective measures to reduce the risk of advancing to more severe cognitive diseases.AimsTo estimate the prevalence and incidence rates of two MCI subtypes\u2014amnestic MCI (aMCI) and vascular cognitive impairment without dementia (VCIND)\u2014and to determine modifiable factors for them among older individuals in a multiregional Chinese cohort.MethodThis 1-year longitudinal study surveyed a random sample of participants aged\u226560 years from a large, community-dwelling cohort in China. Baseline lifestyle data were self-reported, while vascular and comorbid conditions were obtained from medical records and physical examinations. In total, 3514 and 2051 individuals completed the baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments, respectively. Logistic and linear regression analyses were used to identify the modifiable factors for MCI subtypes and predictors of cognitive decline, respectively.ResultsAmong our participants, aMCI and VCIND demonstrated prevalence of 14.83% and 2.71%, respectively, and annual incidence (per 1000 person-years) of 69.6 and 10.6, respectively. The risk factor for aMCI was age, whereas its protective factors were high education level, tea consumption and physical activity. Moreover, VCIND risk factors were age, hypertension and depression. The presence of endocrine disease, cerebral trauma or hypertension was associated with a faster decline in cognition over 1 year.ConclusionsMCI is a serious health problem in China that will only worsen as the population ages if no widespread interventions are implemented. Preventive strategies that promote brain activity and support healthy lifestyle choices are required. We identified modifiable factors for MCI in older individuals. The easy-to-adopt solutions such as tea consumption and physical activity can aid in preventing MCI.Trial registration numberNCT03672448.",

    "content": "AbstractVascular cognitive impairment (VCI) encompasses a wide spectrum of cognitive disorders, ranging from mild cognitive impairment to vascular dementia. Its diagnosis relies on thorough clinical evaluations and neuroimaging. VCI predominately arises from vascular risk factors (VRFs) and cerebrovascular disease, either independently or in conjunction with neurodegeneration. Growing evidence underscores the prevalence of VRFs, highlighting their potential for early prediction of cognitive impairment and dementia in later life. The precise mechanisms linking vascular pathologies to cognitive deficits remain elusive. Chronic cerebrovascular pathology is the most common neuropathological feature of VCI, often interacting synergistically with neurodegenerative processes. Current research efforts are focused on developing and validating reliable biomarkers to unravel the etiology of vascular brain changes in VCI. The collaborative integration of these biomarkers into clinical practice, alongside routine incorporation into neuropathological assessments, presents a promising strategy for predicting and stratifying VCI. The cornerstone of VCI prevention remains the control of VRFs, which includes multi-domain lifestyle modifications. Identifying appropriate pharmacological approaches is also of paramount importance. In this review, we synthesize recent advancements in the field of VCI, including its definition, determinants of vascular risk, pathophysiology, neuroimaging and fluid-correlated biomarkers, predictive methodologies, and current intervention strategies. Increasingly evident is the notion that more rigorous research for VCI, which arises from a complex interplay of physiological events, is still needed to pave the way for better clinical outcomes and enhanced quality of life for affected individuals.",

The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, a surrogate marker of insulin resistance, has shown promise in adult MAFLD detection but requires pediatric-specific validation, particularly when combined with anthropometric measures. This study investigated the association between modified TyG indices and MAFLD, and evaluated their predictive value in adolescents.MethodsThis cross-sectional study analyzed data from 532 adolescents (12\u201318\u00a0years) in the 2017\u20132020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) with complete records. MAFLD diagnosis was based on transient elastography plus metabolic criteria. The investigators employed multivariate linear regression and restricted cubic splines (RCS) to examine linear and nonlinear relationships between modified TyG indices and CAP values. Subgroup analyses were stratified by obesity status, and sensitivity analyses were performed on the NAFLD cohort (n\u2009=\u2009527). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, using Youden's index, evaluated the predictive performance of TyG indices for MAFLD identification.ResultsAmong 130 MAFLD adolescents (vs 402 controls), modified TyG indices demonstrated significantly stronger associations with CAP in fully adjusted models compared to the original TyG index. TyG-WC showed the highest diagnostic accuracy (AUC\u2009=\u20090.923, 95%CI:0.900\u20130.947), followed by TyG-BMI (AUC\u2009=\u20090.917) and TyG-WHtR (AUC\u2009=\u20090.915), while the original TyG index performed poorly (AUC\u2009=\u20090.673). Subgroup analyses revealed particularly strong associations in non-obese participants, and sensitivity analyses confirmed result robustness after excluding potential confounders. Optimal cutoff values provided clinically useful screening thresholds, with TyG-WC achieving 94% sensitivity at 665.94.ConclusionThis study demonstrates that modified TyG indices incorporating anthropometric parameters (particularly TyG-WC) significantly outperform the original TyG index for MAFLD detection in adolescents, with superior diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.915\u20130.923). The robust predictive performance maintained in sensitivity analyses and non-obese subgroups supports their clinical utility as simple, non-invasive screening tools for pediatric MAFLD risk stratification.",

    "content": "Rationale:Foreign body (FB) ingestion is common, particularly among children. While most FBs pass through the gastrointestinal tract without complications, some cases can lead to morbidity or even mortality. Management strategies depend on the size, sharpness, toxicity, and location of the FB. Plain radiographs are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up, especially for radiopaque FBs. Ingestion of dental-related FBs is rare, with reported cases involving orthodontic wires, braces, retainers, and other dental materials. Composite resin-wire splints are commonly used in orthodontics to manage dental traumatic injuries. We present a case of a patient who ingested a composite resin-wire splint, initially misclassified as a sharp FB, leading to unnecessary aggressive treatment.Patient concerns:A 2-year-old girl presented to the emergency department after accidentally ingesting a FB of dental origin. She had a recent traumatic dental injury and displayed no symptoms of ingestion. Initial radiographs revealed a dental wire in the stomach.Diagnoses:Ingestion of orthodontic splint (composite resin-wire splint).Interventions:Considering the pointed tip of the wire, the emergency department physician transferred her to the endoscopy specialist for endoscopic removal. However, given the expected passage into the small bowel after a proper fasting period for endoscopy, close observation with follow-up radiographs was chosen amid parental anxiety.Outcomes:Follow-up imaging showed FB migration to the ascending colon without perforation. Stool inspection revealed the dental wire and 4 composite resins, with the sharp tips covered by the resin, classifying it as a blunt FB. A retrospective review of radiographs revealed faint oval-shaped, mid-level radiopacities at each end of the wire covering the sharp/pointed tips.Lessons:In evaluating orthodontic splints as FBs, identifying faint composite resin on radiographs is crucial for planning milder treatment and alleviating parental anxiety.",

    "content": "ABSTRACTPlastic bronchitis (PB) is a rare and potentially fatal condition characterized by the formation of branching bronchial casts, leading to airway obstruction that can cause severe respiratory failure. We present the case of a 23\u2010month\u2010old male with a recent diagnosis of asthma who presented to our hospital with a worsening 7\u2010day fever and a 5\u2010day cough and shortness of breath. He had a history of two hospitalizations and multiple nebulizations with comparable symptoms before this appointment. His chest CT scan during his stay at our hospital revealed volume loss and consolidation with an air bronchogram in the lateral segment of the right middle lobe and the entire right lower lobe. Bronchoscopy showed that the bronchus intermedius was blocked by a bronchial mucus cast. After removal of the cast, the biopsy's histopathology revealed that the cast was made of fibrinous debris and inflammatory cells, predominantly eosinophils and a small number of neutrophils. As a result, this patient was given a working diagnosis of Type 1 plastic bronchitis. In treating this child's plastic bronchitis, our main objectives were to treat underlying problems, relieve acute airway obstructions, and stop further cast development. Bronchoalveolar culture revealed the growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae for which ceftazidime and avibactam were initiated. A follow\u2010up chest X\u2010ray showed a notable improvement. For both prevention and therapy, we started mucolytics and fibrinolytics for the patient. Montelukast, low\u2010dose azithromycin, bronchodilators, and inhaled corticosteroids were employed to treat the inflammation resulting from his plastic bronchitis. A metered dose inhaler containing budesonide (Budecort) was given to the patient upon discharge to reduce inflammation and enhance lower lung airflow. The patient was given urgent pediatric follow\u2010up on discharge to monitor symptom worsening/improvements. A high index of clinical suspicion is necessary for the diagnosis and management of plastic bronchitis (PB). Management entails ongoing medical care to address underlying diseases and avoid the need for additional casts, as well as the bronchoscopic removal of casts to relieve airway obstruction.",

We quantified HAP exposure by repeated\nmaternal and child personal carbon monoxide (CO) exposure measurements.\nChildren performed oscillometry, an effort-independent lung function\nmeasurement, at age 4. We examined associations between Ghana Randomized Air\nPollution and Health Study stove assignment and prenatal and infant CO\nmeasurements and oscillometry using generalized linear regression models. We\nused reverse distributed lag models to examine time-varying associations\nbetween prenatal CO and oscillometry.Measurements and Main ResultsThe primary oscillometry measure was reactance at 5\u2009Hz, X5, a measure\nof elastic and inertial lung properties. Secondary measures included total,\nlarge airway, and small airway resistance at 5\u2009Hz, 20\u2009Hz, and\nthe difference in resistance at 5\u2009Hz and 20\u2009Hz (R5, R20, and\nR5\u201320, respectively); area of reactance (AX); and resonant frequency.\nOf the 683 children who attended the lung function visit, 567 (83%)\nperformed acceptable oscillometry. A total of 221, 106, and 240 children\nwere from the LPG, improved biomass, and control arms, respectively.\nCompared with control, the improved biomass stove condition was associated\nwith lower reactance at 5\u2009Hz (X5 z-score:\n\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.25; 95% confidence interval\n[CI]\u2009=\u2009\u22120.39, \u22120.11), higher large airway\nresistance (R20 z-score:\n\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.34; 95%\nCI\u2009=\u20090.23, 0.44), and higher AX (AX\nz-score: \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.16; 95%\nCI\u2009=\u20090.06, 0.26), which is suggestive of overall worse\nlung function.

    "content": "ImportanceLingual thyroglossal duct cysts (LTGDCs) are rare congenital anomalies that necessitate proactive surgical intervention due to their potential for life-threatening airway obstruction. The challenging anatomical location of LTGDCs complicates their surgical management, and there are currently no standardized surgical modalities in place.ObjectiveTo analyze the clinical features of LTGDCs and evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of coblation-assisted transoral endoscopic excision of LTGDCs.DesignRetrospective case series (2009-2022) analyzing preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data.SettingTertiary academic center.ParticipantsTwenty-nine patients (20 males, 9 females; ages 3-70, with a median age of 34\u2009years) were diagnosed with LTGDCs, including 7 (24.1%) with recurrent LTGDCs following prior surgeries at other institutions.InterventionCoblation-assisted transoral endoscopic excision of LTGDC using FK retractors and a 30\u00b0 Hopkins telescope for optimal visualization and manipulation.Main Outcome MeasuresComplete cyst excision, postoperative recovery, recurrence rates, complications, and surgical feasibility.ResultsAll LTGDCs were completely excised. During the procedure, it was found that the LTGDCs abutted but did not adhere to the hyoid bone, which allowed for their dissection from the periosteum of the hyoid bone using coblation. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, with an average postoperative stay of 3.1\u2009days (range 1-5\u2009days). No complications, such as bleeding, infection, or airway obstruction, occurred. The mean follow-up period was 5.3\u2009years (range 6\u2009months to 12.4\u2009years), with no recurrences observed during this time.ConclusionsCoblation-assisted transoral endoscopic excision is a reliable, effective, and minimally invasive approach for managing LTGDCs. It ensures complete removal with low recurrence and complication rates, aided by superior visualization and manipulation space provided by FK retractors and a 30\u00b0 Hopkins telescope.RelevanceThis technique offers a safe alternative to traditional surgeries, reducing trauma and enhancing recovery. Future studies should explore comparisons with other surgical modalities to validate their broader applicability.",

    "content": "AbstractBackgroundTracheal intubation can be used for ventilation to ensure an unobstructed respiratory tract, and it is the most common respiratory support technique used in paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients. Orotracheal intubation is usually the preferred method of tracheal intubation. However, it can cause stress\u2010related damage to the oral mucosa. Identifying the factors that cause oral mucosal pressure injury (OMPI) can prevent its occurrence in children with oral endotracheal intubation.AimTo examine the characteristics of OMPI in children who underwent orotracheal intubation in the PICU and to assess their influencing factors.Study DesignAn observational, prospective study. Data were gathered from the PICU of a tertiary hospital in China between January 2023 and October 2023. The patient data were obtained from the \u2018General Information Questionnaire\u2019, \u2018Paediatric Critical Illness Score\u2019, \u2018STRONGkids Scale\u2019 and \u2018OMPI Staging and Assessment Tools\u2019. Data analysis was subsequently performed using univariate and logistic regression analyses.ResultsA total of 187 children who underwent orotracheal intubation were analysed. During the observation period, 44.92% (n\u2009=\u200984) of the children developed OMPI. It comprised 63.10% (n\u2009=\u200953) of stage I injuries, 33.33% (n\u2009=\u200928) of stage II injuries and 3.57% (n\u2009=\u20093) of stage III injuries. The common injury sites were the lower jaw (48.81%), upper jaw (29.76%), tongue (20.24%) and joints (10.71%). The logistic regression analysis results revealed that high critical illness (OR\u2009=\u20090.835, 95% CI: 0.726\u20130.961), long intubation time (OR\u2009=\u20091.043, 95% CI: 1.021\u20131.067), prone ventilation (OR\u2009=\u20096.708, 95% CI: 1.421\u201331.670), hypothermia (OR\u2009=\u20095.831, 95% CI: 1.208\u201328.149), use of dental pads (OR\u2009=\u20095.520, 95% CI: 1.150\u201326.487) and low albumin levels (OR\u2009=\u20096.238, 95% CI: 1.285\u201330.281) were the main contributing factors for OMPI in children with orotracheal intubation (p\u2009<\u2009.05).ConclusionsThe occurrence of OMPI in children who underwent orotracheal intubation in the PICU was notable and was predominantly observed in stages I and II. Consequently, clinical nursing personnel should proactively recognize risk factors and administer timely interventions to mitigate the occurrence of OMPI in such children.Relevance to Clinical PracticeThe incidence of OMPI in children who underwent orotracheal intubation was relatively high. Nurses and doctors should closely monitor the risk factors for orotracheal intubation in children to prevent the occurrence of OMPI.",

An interdisciplinary approach, incorporating social listening, qualitative focus groups, and co-design workshops, was used to achieve this goal.MethodsDigital tools were designed and evaluated using a 4-phase approach that included: (1) social listening to characterize lived experiences with COVID-19 trials as self-reported by online users, (2) qualitative focus groups with young adults to explore specific lived attitudes and experiences related to COVID-19 clinical research hesitancy and engagement, (3) a series of cocreation and co-design workshops to build digital tools aimed at encouraging clinical trial participation, and (4) a controlled intercept study to assess the usability and specific outcome measures of the co-designed digital tools among young adults.ResultsA significantly higher change in the likelihood of participating in a clinical trial post exposure was observed among study participants when exposed to prototypes of a mobile app (\u0394=0.74 on a 10-point scale, P<.01) and website (\u0394=0.93, P<.01) compared to those exposed to a Facebook ad (\u0394=0.21) but not a digital flyer (\u0394=0.58).

    "content": "Background: The main feature of osteoarthritis (OA) is the deterioration of articular cartilage, but numerous studies have demonstrated the role of synovial inflammation in the early stages of the disease, leading to further progression of OA. The WNT signaling pathway is involved in numerous activities in joint tissue, but there is a lack of evidence considering the role of WNT in OA synovitis. Our research aims to investigate the expression of WNT Family Member 5A/B (WNT5A/B), \u03b2-catenin, acetyl-\u03b1-tubulin, Dishevelled-1 (DVL-1), and Inversin (INV) in the synovial membrane of osteoarthritis (OA) hips. Methods: The immunohistochemical expressions of the aforementioned proteins in the synovial membrane were analyzed and compared with samples of control group participants with fractured femoral necks. Results: The immunoexpression of acetyl-\u03b1-tubulin was significantly increased in the intima (p < 0.0001) and subintima (p < 0.0001) of the group with OA compared with the intima and subintima of the control group. At the same time, acetyl-\u03b1-tubulin was also more highly expressed in the intima of the OA group than in the subintima of the OA group (p < 0.05); we found the same expression pattern in the control group (p < 0.0001). The differential analysis of the GEO dataset did not show significant differences between the osteoarthritis (OA) and control groups in the expression of TUBA1A. \u03b2-catenin was significantly increased in the subintima (p < 0.01) of the group with OA compared to the subintima of the control group. WNT expression has significantly higher positivity in the subintima than in the intima, especially in the control group (p < 0.01). WNT5A and WNT5B were significantly down-regulated in OA compared to the control in the differential analysis of the GEO dataset. The expression of INV and DVL-1 in our study and the differential analysis of the GEO dataset did not differ significantly between the osteoarthritis (OA) and control groups. Conclusions: Based on our results, we suggest that acetyl-\u03b1-tubulin and \u03b2-catenin might be involved in synovial membrane inflammation in OA and serve as potential therapeutic targets.",

    "content": "Rationale: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common gastrointestinal disease affecting nearly 3 million people annually worldwide. Although AP is typically self-limiting, up to 20% of patients may develop life-threatening complications. Individuals who suffer from AP also have an increased likelihood of developing other exocrine and endocrine pancreatic disorders. However, to date, there are no specific, targeted treatment modalities that can effectively improve the clinical outcomes of AP.Leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) is a multifunctional protein with established roles in inflammation and cell mitosis. This study aims to investigate the functional role of LRG1 in AP progression and develop LRG1-targeted AP therapeutics.Methods: Levels of circulating and tissue LRG1 were determined in human patient samples and mouse models of caerulein-induced AP and pancreatic duct ligation-induced AP. Histopathological grading, amylase assay, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis and Western blotting were used to evaluate the extent of pancreatic damage and recovery following caerulein-induced AP in both wild-type and Lrg1-/- mice. Primary acinar cells were also isolated from mice for in-vitro mechanistic studies. LRG1 neutralizing antibody was administered post-AP induction to evaluate its therapeutic potential in improving AP outcomes.Results: LRG1 is markedly increased in serum and acinar cells of AP patients and C57BL/6 mice subjected to caerulein-induced AP or pancreatic duct ligation-induced AP. Despite demonstrating no obvious pancreatic dysfunction, Lrg1-/- mice exhibited more severe pancreatic damage and inflammation during the early stages of caerulein-induced AP. However, the resolution of AP was accelerated in the absence of Lrg1, which is at least partially due to LRG1's role in regulating the expression of trophic cholecystokinin (CCK) Type 1 receptor (CCK1R) via the TGF\u03b2/ALK5/AKT pathway in acinar cells. Importantly, the administration of an LRG1-blocking antibody promoted AP recovery, evidenced by reduced overall inflammation and increased acinar cell proliferation.Conclusions: Our data provide compelling evidence for targeting LRG1 as a potential innovative therapy for promoting AP recovery.",

In the Establishing Meaningful Patient-Centered Outcomes with Relevance for Patients with Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) project, we aimed to identify patient-important outcomes and discuss the effect of PKD on patients.MethodsNine focus groups were held with adult patients with PKD, caregivers, and clinical or research experts in PKD. We used a nominal, multivote technique to rank patient-important outcomes to be prioritized by future PKD research. We conducted a thematic analysis of verbatim transcriptions to identify themes regarding the effect of PKD on their daily lives. Other focus group topics included insurability and patient engagement.ResultsNinety patients and/or caregivers and eight clinicians and/or researchers participated in the focus groups. Nine focus groups yielded 35 outcomes important to patients that were grouped into six categories, ranked in order of importance: kidney health, comorbidities, lifestyle, psychological effect, family and awareness, and mortality. Regarding the effect of PKD on the patient's daily lives, we identified five themes, listed in order of importance: psychological effect, effect on daily living, issues affecting decision making, health care-related issues, and PKD-specific testing dilemmas.ConclusionsThis study of stakeholder engagement in patients with PKD revealed important priorities and values that should be considered for future research and when caring for patients with PKD. Future research should focus on kidney health and managing comorbidities in patients with PKD. This will help to bridge the knowledge gap and develop meaningful comparative effectiveness research in PKD.",

    "content": "Background\nA well-defined treatment strategy for elderly patients with resectable pancreatic cancer has not been established. Multiple reports have found that highly selected older patients with cancer may successfully undergo pancreatectomy. However, multimodality therapy is essential for long-term survival, and elderly patients are at high risk for not receiving adjuvant therapy following surgery. We sought to describe outcomes associated with an individualized multimodality approach to treatment of elderly patients with pancreatic cancer.\n\n\nStudy Design:\nThe treatment plan, short-term outcomes and overall survival of all patients 70+ years old who presented to our institution over a 9-year period and were treated for anatomically resectable pancreatic cancer were retrospectively reviewed.\n\n\nResults:\n179 (76%) of 236 patients with resectable pancreatic cancer were treated with curative intent. 153 (85%) of these patients received neoadjuvant therapy prior to intended resection. Of them, 74 (48%) underwent pancreatectomy and 79 did not due to disease progression (n=46), insufficient performance status (n=23), or other reasons (n=10). Among the 26 patients who underwent surgery first, 11 (42%) received postoperative therapy. Univariate predictors of longer survival following pancreatectomy were absence of comorbidity, low CA19\u20139 level, negative lymph nodes, and receipt of preoperative therapy. None of the predictors of survival were significant in multivariable analysis. Resected patients had a 2% in-hospital mortality rate and 91% were discharged home.\n\n\nConclusion:\n36% of all patients 70 years and older with anatomically resectable pancreatic cancer received all components of multimodality therapy and over 90% who underwent pancreatectomy were discharged home. These data demonstrate a role for neoadjuvant therapy in selecting elderly patients for surgery and support further studies to refine individualized treatment protocols for this high-risk group of patients.",

    "content": "The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) bacteria poses a major global health threat, compounded by the limited development of new antibiotics. To address this challenge, alternative strategies, including nanoparticle-based therapies, are being explored. This study investigates the antimicrobial properties of green-synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) derived from leaf extracts of Ocimum gratissimum (OG), Apium graveolens (AG), and Aloe arborescens (AA). These plant extracts act as reducing, capping, and stabilizing agents during the synthesis process. By controlling the reaction parameters, the synthesized AgNPs displayed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) peaks at 434, 427, and 435 nm for OG, AG, and AA, respectively, indicating successful nanoparticle formation. The particles were predominantly spherical, with average sizes of 28.5 \u00b1 6.3 nm (AgNPs-OG), 15.07 \u00b1 3.8 nm (AgNPs-AA), and 20.2 \u00b1 2.5 nm (AgNPs-AG), although some particles exhibited triangular and cylindrical shapes. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the formation of crystalline, face-centered cubic (FCC) metallic silver, while Fourier Transformation Infrared (FTIR) identified functional groups such as alcohols, amines, amides, carboxyl, and esters capping the surface of AgNPs. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) further confirmed the purity of the AgNPs. The antimicrobial activity of the synthesized AgNPs was tested against Gram-negative E. coli and Gram-positive S. aureus bacteria. Notably, AgNPs demonstrated high antimicrobial efficacy, particularly with smaller-sized, spherical particles showing superior performance. The minimum inhibitory concentration was as low as 1.016 \u03bcg mL\u22121, highlighting the strong antimicrobial potential of AgNPs, whereas the minimum bactericidal concentration was recorded for E. coli, indicating greater susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria to AgNPs and a concentration-dependent bactericidal effect. A comparison analysis showed that the antimicrobial effectiveness of the aqueous extract was significantly enhanced when AgNPs were incorporated, whereas higher antimicrobial performance was observed for green-synthesized AgNPs compared with wet chemically synthesized AgNPs reported in the literature. This is attributed to enhanced biocompatibility and a synergistic effect between the nanoparticles and plant-derived bioactive compounds. The mechanism of action of AgNPs involves silver ion (Ag+) release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation via surface oxidation and photoactivation. These findings underscore the potential of green-synthesized AgNPs as an alternative strategy in mitigating AMR.",

    "content": "BackgroundAtherosclerosis is a widely studied pathophysiological foundation of cardiovascular diseases. Inflammation and dyslipidemia are risk factors that promote the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. The gut microbiota and their metabolites are considered independent risk factors for atherosclerosis. Polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids, as the extracts of Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc. and Crataegus pinnatifida Bunge, have shown excellent cardiovascular protective effects. However, the underlying mechanism requires further investigation. Our study aimed to explore the anti-atherosclerotic mechanism through gut microbiota and their metabolites.MethodsApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice were fed either a normal-chow diet or a high-fat diet. The polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids group received varied doses of polydatin and hawthorn flavonoids: a high dose (polydatin 200\u00a0mg/kg daily; hawthorn flavonoids 100\u00a0mg/kg daily), a medium dose (polydatin 100\u00a0mg/kg daily; hawthorn flavonoids 50\u00a0mg/kg daily), and a low dose (polydatin 50\u00a0mg/kg daily; hawthorn flavonoids 25\u00a0mg/kg daily). The control and model groups were administered distilled water (0.2\u00a0mL daily). The experiment lasted for 24\u00a0weeks.ResultsPolydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids administration significantly reduced lipid and inflammatory cytokine levels, meanwhile, the atherosclerotic lesions in a high-fat diet-induced ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice were significantly decreased. Additionally, polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids also inhibited the enhancement of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), trimethylamine (TMA) levels of HFD-induced ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice by regulating the expression of hepatic flavin-containing enzyme monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). 16S rRNA sequencing results demonstrated that high-dose polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids treatment increased the abundance of Actinobacteriota, Atopobiaceae and Coriobacteriaea_UCG-002, and decreased the abundance of Desulfobacterota. Norank_f_Muribaculaceae was enriched in the medium-dose polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids and simvastatin groups, and Lactobacillus was mainly increased in the simvastatin and the low-dose polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids groups. According to the metagenetic results, functional annotations also suggested that the biological processes of each group mainly focused on metabolism-related processes. Specifically, polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids may regulate the abundance of TMA-producing bacteria (Coriobacteriaceae, Desulfovibrio, Muribaculum, and Clostridium) and related enzymes in glycolipid metabolic pathways to exert an important effect on the prevention of atherosclerosis.ConclusionOur results suggested that polydatin combined with hawthorn flavonoids could regulate the glucolipid metabolism-related pathway, attenuate inflammatory cytokine levels, and reduce atherosclerotic plaques by remodeling gut microbiota.",

We found that in mice fed a high-fat diet, supplementing with GRP reduced body weight and liver index, significantly improved serum lipid levels and markers of liver damage, and mitigated oxidative stress and inflammation. Mechanistically, in these hyperlipidemic mice, the size of fat cells was reduced by GRP, and the abnormal accumulation of lipid droplets was reduced. We also found that GRP regulates the composition of the intestinal microbiota, including the ratio of Firmicutes to Mycobacteria F/B and the levels of Blautia spp., which have been shown to alleviate liver damage and treat hyperlipidemia. Metabolite pathway analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes identified the glycolysis/glycolytic metabolism and propionate metabolism pathways as potential targets for GRP in the amelioration of hyperlipidemia.",

This study was also undertaken to analyze the potential relationship between the body constitutions of patients, syndrome elements, and biological indicators, as well as to investigate the effect of Yiqi Wenyang Jiedu prescription (YWJP) on symptoms and biological indicators before and after treatment.Result:Yang-deficiency and Qi-deficiency were identified as prevalent imbalanced constitutions among patients with recurrent and metastatic gastric cancer. The primary syndrome factors associated with disease localization included the spleen-stomach and liver, with the main syndrome elements being Qi-deficiency, Yang-deficiency, and Qi-stagnation. Patients with Qi-deficiency and Yang-deficiency constitutions exhibited lower BMI and higher monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR). A notable positive correlation was observed between cold (Yang-deficiency) and BMI, as well as between Qi-deficiency constitution and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Furthermore, YWJP demonstrated efficacy in alleviating symptoms associated with Qi-deficiency and Yang-deficiency in patients with recurrent and metastatic gastric cancer, including dyspnea, fatigue, diaphoresis, cold intolerance, abdominal sounds, postural changes, and abdominal distension.Discussion:Yang-deficiency and Qi-deficiency emerged as prevalent constitutional patterns in patients with recurrent and metastatic gastric cancer. Notably, BMI, MLR, and NLR may serve as physiological indicators of these conditions. Furthermore, YWJP treatment demonstrated potential efficacy in alleviating symptoms associated with Qi-deficiency and Yang-deficiency in this patient population.Clinical Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR2200055826.",

Primarily induced by the surfeit of intracellular iron and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), it has also been termed iron-dependent oxidative cell death. Osteoporosis (OP) is a widespread bone disorder. In recent years, a surge in research has revealed that interventions involving Chinese herbs can regulate ferroptosis, presenting novel strategies for the management of bone ailments, including OP. The aim of this paper is to elucidate the intricate relationship between ferroptosis and OP by delving into the fundamental mechanisms underlying ferroptosis.

    "content": "Hyperphosphataemia is a key contributor to oxidative stress (OS) and cellular dysfunction across various pathological conditions. While numerous studies have associated phosphate overload with redox imbalances, the role of NADPH oxidase (NOX) in this process has received limited attention. NOX enzymes are major enzymatic sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and their activation has been implicated in the progression of chronic kidney disease, vascular calcification, metabolic disorders, and cancer development. Under hyperphosphataemic conditions, excessive ROS production exacerbates endothelial dysfunction, promotes vascular smooth muscle cell transdifferentiation, induces chronic inflammation, and facilitates tumour progression. Despite increasing evidence linking phosphate metabolism to NOX activation, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly characterised. This review critically examines the relationship between hyperphosphataemia and NADPH oxidase-mediated OS and explores its impact on disease pathophysiology. By providing an integrated analysis of the current findings, this work aims to highlight the pathological consequences of phosphate-induced OS and identify potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate its effects.",

In particular, treatment of insomnia disorder using TCM preventive treatment is rarely mentioned. Therefore, to improve the rehabilitation and quality of life of patients with insomnia disorder and its high-risk groups, the Affiliated TCM Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University and the Institute of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, CACMS have jointly initiated the compilation of the \u201cPractice guideline for TCM preventive treatment of Insomnia disorder\u201d.MethodsThe guideline will adhere to the principles outlined in WHO Handbook for Guidelines Development, 2nd Edition by the World Health Organization and the Guidelines for the Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine by the Chinese Society of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations will be based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The key steps in developing the guideline include: (1) Establishing Guideline Project Group; (2) Conflict of interest management; (3) Research, Selection and Identification of Clinical Questions; (4) Evidence search and evaluation; (5) Quality and grading of evidence; (6) Decision Table for Forming Recommendations; (7) Recommendation Consensus and Determination; (8) Writing the first draft of the guideline; (9) Peer review.DiscussionBased on the theoretical system of \u201cTCM preventive treatment\u201d of Chinese medicine this guideline is to construct a three-tier preventive framework. The development of this guideline can systematically integrate the characteristic techniques of TCM, such as physical identification, emotional regulation, acupuncture and massage, with the evidence-based evidence of modern sleep medicine, and build a new management model.ConclusionThis guideline will serve as an evidence-based reference for standardized TCM preventive treatment methods, promoting the standardization and normative application of TCM preventive treatment in insomnia disorder.

    "content": "BackgroundIntracardiac masses encompass a spectrum of pathologies, including tumors, thrombi, and other proliferative lesions, with left atrial involvement being more common than right atrial involvement. In particular, spherical thrombi in the right atrium are exceedingly rare. Diagnostic evaluation relies on modalities such as transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). TEE provides detailed information regarding the mass\u2019s location, number, size, and mobility, while CMR and MDCT offer insights into tissue characterization. In this report, we describe a case in which both TEE and CMR misdiagnosed a spherical thrombus as a myxoma. By analyzing the features of TEE and CMR, we summarize the reasons for this misdiagnosis, aiming to serve as a cautionary reminder for clinicians.Case summaryWe report a case of a 59-year-old male, whose past medical history was notable only for a childhood lower extremity trauma (details unknown and not requiring hospitalization or treatment) and no history of diabetes, hypertension, prolonged immobilization, or familial diseases. A spherical mass was incidentally detected in the right atrium during a routine examination. Initial transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), including three-dimensional imaging, revealed a hyperechoic mass with a distinct stalk attached to the interatrial septum near the inferior vena cava, findings that were initially interpreted as consistent with a myxoma. However, subsequent surgical resection and histopathological analysis demonstrated fibrous tissue proliferation and collagenization, confirming the lesion as a thrombus. The unique spherical configuration and its location underscore the potential for misdiagnosis when relying solely on conventional imaging modalities.ConclusionRight atrial thrombi are rare findings observed on echocardiography. This case illustrates an incidental spherical thrombus located near the inferior vena cava entrance at the top of the right atrium. The echocardiographic features of this thrombus can resemble those of a myxoma, necessitating careful differentiation through additional examinations. In this case, the misdiagnosis on TEE was attributed to the mass displaying slightly increased echogenicity, a narrow attachment to the right atrium near the inferior vena cava, and a degree of mobility. Typically, thrombi appear hypoechoic; however, the slightly elevated echogenicity observed here may be due to the chronicity of thrombus formation, which could also account for the narrow attachment. According to the PLACE-T scoring system, the following points were assigned:P (Patient history): 0 points.L (Lobulation): Lobulated contour, 0 points.Attachment site width: Narrow stalk (base diameter/maximal diameter <0.3), +2 points.Clinical context: No relevant medical history, 0 points.Echogenicity pattern: Heterogeneous echogenicity, +1 point.T (Tissue characterization): No specific features, 0 points.With a total score of 3 points, the probability of a thrombus is high (sensitivity 92% and specificity 85% for scores \u22643). When TEE is not feasible or yields uncertain findings, other non-invasive imaging modalities such as multi-slice spiral CT (MDCT) or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) may be considered. Although these techniques are predominantly used for left atrial assessment\u2014MDCT, for instance, can successfully identify left atrial thrombus with a negative predictive value of 100% and a positive predictive value ranging from 41% to 92%\u2014the accuracy of differentiating right atrial masses remains uncertain. Therefore, in similar cases, it is imperative to integrate the patient\u2019s clinical history, multiple auxiliary examination results, and the PLACE-T score rather than relying solely on the features observed on TEE.",

Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we analyzed the gut microbiome and found that chicks exposed to TM had a different composition of gut bacteria, particularly by increasing beneficial bacterial taxa such as Oscillospirales. These microbial changes may improve the birds\u2019 immune response to LPS-induced stress, as TM-treated birds avoided the hypothermic phase typically triggered by LPS. These findings suggest that TM could be a cost-effective and easily applicable way to improve poultry health, reduce antibiotic dependence, and support sustainable farming practices.",

This study explored the mechanism of the long-24-h ahemeral light cycle improving eggshell quality of hens in late laying stage. Two sets of 260 Hy-Line brown laying hens, aged 74 weeks, were randomized, with 65 chickens in each group. One was treated to a standard light cycle (24 h, 16L:8D), whereas the other was subjected to a long-24 h ahemeral light cycle (28 h, 16L:12D). The experimental cycle was 12 weeks. The results indicated that the long-24 h ahemeral light cycle did not influence laying performance (P > 0.05); however, eggshell strength and thickness was dramatically enhanced (P < 0.05). The serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 and ALP exhibited comparable changes, whereas PTH, PCT, and OT displayed contrasting variations between the two groups. Transcriptome sequencing revealed 889 common genes exhibiting rhythmic expression in both groups, with an average phase advance of 7.41 h. In comparison to the 16L:8D group, 97.41 % of genes exhibited phase advancement in the 16L:12D group. Based on the findings of the functional analysis, we identified four genes associated with bone metabolism and examined their expression patterns: CTNNB1, BMPR2, BMP7, and PDIA3. The expression trend of BMPR2 gene was similar to that of serum 1,25(OH)2D3, and the expression trend of BMP7 gene was similar to that of serum OT. The mRNA expression patterns of PDIA3 and BMP7 were inversely related, whereas CTNNB1 and BMPR2 exhibited comparable trends. The mRNA expression of CTNNB1, PDIA3, and BMP7 correlated with eggshell formation. The mRNA expression of BMPR2 significantly elevated during eggshell formation in the 16L:8D group, whereas it remained low during the daylight in comparison to darkness in the 16L:12D group. In summary, the change of light cycle affects the biological rhythm of laying hens, and we found four genes related to bone metabolism, CTNNB1, BMPR2, BMP7 and PDIA3, which specifically responded to the long-24 h ahemeral light cycle and possibly participated in the improvement of eggshell quality.",

In developing countries, the evidence is scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the association between the consumption of different types of dairy products and obesity in Chilean adults.Materials and methodsA cross-sectional study, stratified by sex and age, was carried out using a validated online survey to assess the consumption of dairy products among adults living in Chile. Dairy product consumption was then classified into tertiles. Obesity was determined based on self-reported body mass index (BMI) \u2265 30\u2009kg/m2. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between dairy consumption and obesity, adjusting for several confounding variables.ResultsIn total, 2008 participants were included in the analyses. Forty-seven percent, 39% and 14% belonged to the <35 years, 35\u201360 years, and \u226560-year groups, respectively. 55% were female, 86% had a low-medium socioeconomic level. Cow-derived cheese, milk, and yogurt were the most commonly consumed dairy products. Obese participants had a lower total consumption of dairy products (17.1%) than normal-weight subjects (25.7%, p<0.05). Higher cheese intake was significantly associated with a lower obesity risk (ORadj: 0.70; 95%CI 0.51\u20130.96, p<0.05).

The findings indicated that PSP treatment in T2DM mice could obviously decrease the fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin levels, ameliorate glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, lipid, and inflammatory factor levels, attenuate pancreatic and liver damage, and increase the fecal SCFA content. In addition, PSP could modulate the composition of gut microbiota in T2DM mice, resulting in the relative abundance of Firmicutes decreasing and that of Bacteroidetes increasing, along with the abundance of beneficial flora significantly increasing, especially SCFA-producing bacteria. The findings indicate that PSP administration protected against diabetes by controlling disordered glucolipid metabolism and modulating the gut microbiota, which provides a valuable strategy for the utilization of PSP to treat T2DM.",

Since direct measurement of insulin resistance is impractical in routine care, it offers a more accessible alternative with potential broad clinical application. The TyG index and AI can serve as useful substitute biomarkers and could help in the management of glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 200 T2DM participants, divided into two groups: 100 with good glycemic control (<7.0%) and 100 with poor control (\u22657.0%), based on HbA1c levels. Lipid profile and HbA1c were measured using Chem-7 (Erba Mannheim, India) and Insta Check semi-auto analyzers. TyG index, TyG-body mass index (BMI), and TyG-waist circumference (WC) were calculated using standard formulas. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, US), with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant.Results: Among 200 subjects, 63% were men and 37% were women. The mean age for type 2 diabetes subjects is 61.24 \u00b1 7.25 years. The mean level of the TyG index in poor glycemic control is significantly higher (30.36 \u00b1 5.51, p < 0.001) than that of good glycemic control (4.06 \u00b1 0.05, p < 0.001). A significant positive correlation was observed between the TyG index and poor glycemic control. The TyG index has good predictive ability in poor glycemic control (area under the curve (AUC): 0.88; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83-0.92). The TyG optimal cutoff is \u22655.22 with 78.22% sensitivity and 94.06% specificity.Conclusion: The TyG index shows a significant correlation with glycemic control and could serve as a valuable supportive marker for T2DM, particularly in smaller clinical settings.",

The expression of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), p62, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), Kelch\u2010like ECH\u2010associating protein (Keap1), nuclear factor E2\u2010related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase\u20101(HO\u20101) mRNA was detected by real\u2010time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010qPCR). The protein expression of HDAC6, Nrf2, and nod\u2010like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) was detected by western blotting.ResultsAt concentrations of less than 100\u2009\u03bcmol/L, EGCG can promote cell proliferation and significantly inhibit the levels of TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20101\u03b2. Moreover, EGCG can activate the Nrf2 pathway and inhibit ROS production. Furthermore, EGCG inhibited the expression of HDAC6 and promoted the expression of p62 and Hsp70, indicating that the anti\u2010inflammatory and antioxidant effects of EGCG are closely related to HDAC6.ConclusionsEGCG can regulate LPS\u2010induced oxidative stress levels of hPDLCs through the Keap1/Nrf2/HO\u20101 pathway and reduce the expression of HDAC6\u2010related factors. Therefore, HDAC6 may be a potential target for EGCG in the treatment of periodontal inflammation and oxidative stress.",

Methods: A 1:1 mole ratio of TA:LYS was used to prepare corresponding spherical nanogels employing formaldehyde as a linker via the Mannich reaction. Results: The attained p(TA-co-LYS) particles were in 283 \u00b1 57 nm size ranges (via SEM analysis) and possessed smooth surfaces. The zeta potential measurements of p(TA-co-LYS) nanogels suspension at different solution pHs revealed the isoelectric point (IEP) of pH 4.9, suggesting that the particles are negatively charged at the physiological pH range (e.g., at 7.4). In addition to the antioxidant efficacy of nanogels confirmed by three different tests, p(TA-co-LYS) particles showed significant Fe(II) ion chelating capacity at 350 \u00b5g/mL concentrations compared to bare TA, which is 21%, whereas the LYS molecule had a chelating capacity of 100% at the same concentrations. Moreover, it was found that p(TA-co-LYS) nanogels inhibited the Acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) at a concentration-dependent profile, e.g., at 333 \u00b5g/mL concentration of p(TA-co-LYS), 57.2% of the enzyme AChE activity was inhibited. Furthermore, the minimum inhibition concentrations of p(TA-co-LYS) nanogels of Gram-negative Escherichia\u00a0coli (ATCC 8739) and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538) were determined as 12.5 mg/mL. Conclusions: As cytotoxicity studies of p(TA-co-LYS) nanogels on L929 fibroblast cells also ascertained that these particles can be safely used in many biomedical applications, including antioxidant materials, drug delivery devices, and enzyme inhibitors.",

Host\u2013microbiota interactions play a critical role in maintaining ECM balance; however, during dysbiosis, this regulation is disrupted, leading to compromised barrier integrity, pathogen translocation into circulation, and the development of systemic diseases and cancer. This review highlights the bidirectional relationship between MMP expression/activity and microbiota dysbiosis, emphasizing tissue-specific alterations in MMP activity that contribute to disease progression. In addition, it integrates interdisciplinary evidence to illustrate the MMP-dependent mechanisms underlying various pathologies associated with oral and gut microbiome dysbiosis, including long-range effects through the gut\u2013skin and gut\u2013brain axes. Thus, this review introduces the emerging field of MatrixBiome, which explores the complex interactions between the ECM, microbiota, and host tissues.

Considering SMCSO is found at a higher abundance compared to the glucosinolates, there are limited reports on its effect on health, with the majority of the evidence on the beneficial effects on glucose metabolism in rodent models. In the current study, we investigated the metabolic effects of SMCSO and its metabolite, S\u2010methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTSO), on prostate cancer metabolism. DU145 prostate cancer cells were cultured in 5.5\u00a0mM (basal), 10\u00a0mM (intermediate) and 25\u00a0mM (high) glucose concentrations in the presence of SMCSO or MMTSO (100\u00a0\u00b5M). Using Seahorse technology, MMTSO but not SMCSO reduced mitochondrial metabolism, mitochondrial ATP, and the percentage of oxidative phosphorylation and increased the fatty acid dependency of DU145 cells. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses observed cellular and energy metabolism pathways and immune response changes.These data show that MMTSO alters several features of energy metabolism in DU145 prostate cancer cells, shifting them towards a non\u2010cancerous phenotype. These data are consistent with the notion that MMTSO may contribute to the beneficial effects of a broccoli\u2010rich diet and metabolic effects of prostate cancer.",

The immune system\u2019s protective immunosuppressive response to helminth invasion minimizes inflammation-induced cell damage and DNA mutations, lowering the risk of colorectal cancer precursor lesions. Helminth infection-mediated immunosuppression can hasten colorectal cancer growth and metastasis, which is detrimental to patient outcomes. Some helminth derivatives can activate immune cells to attack cancer cells, making them potentially useful as colorectal cancer vaccines or therapies. This review also covers gene editing approaches. We discovered that using CRISPR/Cas9 to inhibit live helminths modulates miRNA, which limits tumor growth. We propose more multicenter studies into helminth therapy\u2019s long-term effects and immune regulation pathways.

    "content": "Background. Worldwide, colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer. It is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Recent studies establish a relationship between natural compounds from plants with the prevention and treatment of cancer. Specifically, glucosinolates with antitumoral capacity and polyphenols with the ability to scavenge free radicals that can cause cell damage have been identified in the Brassicaceae family. Objectives. Based on the previously mentioned factors, this study aimed to develop a nutraceutical made with extracts from different Brassicaceae seeds and study its antioxidant and antiproliferative action in vitro and in vivo using the AOM/DSS model in CC57BL6J mice. Results. Extract from the seeds of Eruca sativa and Sinapis alba showed the highest antioxidant capacity among the different species studied and were selected for nutraceutical formulation, which was potentially absorbable (73%) after an in vitro digestion process. In total, thirty compounds were identified in the nutraceutical that could be responsible for its antioxidant and tumoral prevention capacity. The intake of nutraceutical was a successful intervention to prevent the development of polyps by 31.6% and their size by 53.9%. When the nutritional intervention was used in combination with a physical exercise protocol, these parameters dropped to 52.3% and 62.6%, respectively. Conclusions. These findings suggest that the consumption of a diet rich in bioactive compounds from Brassica species, in combination with physical activity, is a valuable prevention strategy for colorectal cancer. However, more research is required to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these interventions in clinical settings.",

This study assessed the diet-related CRC burden from 1990 to 2021 in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations and estimated the burden until 2050. Methods: Data for OECD countries on diet-related CRC disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and deaths were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease 2021 study. The estimated annual percent change (EAPC) was calculated to analyse the CRC burden attributable to dietary factors. A generalised additive model with a negative binomial distribution was used to predict the future burden of CRC attributable to dietary factors from 2021 to 2050. Results: In 2021, the age-standardised percentages of diet-related CRC DALYs and deaths were 39.1% (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 9.3, 61.3) and 39.0% (95% UI: 9.7, 60.9), respectively, in the OECD countries. Between 1990 and 2021, the age-standardised DALYs decreased from 185 to 129 per 100,000, and deaths decreased from 8 to 6 per 100,000 population for OECD countries. Similarly, the EAPC in the rates showed a downward trend (EAPCdeaths = \u22121.26 and EAPCDALYs = \u22121.20). The estimated diet-related CRC DALYs and deaths are projected to increase to 4.1 million DALYs and 0.2 million deaths by 2050. There is a downward trend in CRC deaths (EAPC = 1.33 for both sexes) and in DALYs (\u22120.90 for males and \u22121.0 for females) from 1990 to 2050. Conclusions: The diet-related CRC burden remains significant.

The aim of this study was to assess the methylation levels of specific DNA sequences from the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes in a population with ALS to elucidate their relationship with nutritional status and the evolution of the disease. Methods: Patients with ALS were evaluated between 2013 and 2021 (n = 66). They were categorized according to their nutritional status, using the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria, and disease progression, using the ALS Functional Rating (ALSFRS-R) Scale. DNA samples were extracted from leukocytes at the time of diagnosis for analysis of DNA methylation levels of markers of oxidative stress, mitochondrial function and global methylation (D-loop, GSTP1, and LINE-1). Results: According to the GLIM criteria, 29 (43.9%) patients had malnutrition (22.7%\u2014moderate; 21.2%\u2014severe), which was positively correlated with ALS disease progression (r = 0.414; p < 0.01) and death (r = 0.687; p < 0.01). Mortality occurred in 43.9% of the patients (median time to death, 18.7 (1.7\u201382.7) months). A significant association was observed between DNA methylation levels of the D-loop, GSTP1, and the CpG1 site of LINE-1 and malnutrition, disease progression at diagnosis, and death. The D-loop was the best predictor of malnutrition (AUC, 0.79; p < 0.01), disease progression (AUC, 0.70; p < 0.01), and mortality (AUC, 0.71; p < 0.01). Conclusions: This study revealed, for the first time, the early detection of D-loop methylation levels as a potential biomarker of nutritional status in patients with ALS, which may be useful for personalized nutritional management aimed at counteracting disease progression.",

Clinical data suggest that the \u03b12\u2010adrenergic receptor (AdR\u2010\u03b12) agonist dexmedetomidine (Dex) can influence coagulation in stress\u2010exposed intensive care unit patients. Given the important role of protease\u2010activated receptor\u20102 (PAR\u20102) in vascular pathobiology, we aimed to investigate the potential effects of Dex on stress\u2010related thrombus formation, focusing on the PAR\u20102 signaling pathway. Eight\u2010week\u2010old male mice underwent non\u2010stress and immobilization stress with Dex treatment for 2\u2009weeks and were then subjected to carotid artery thrombosis induction using ferric chloride (FeCl3). On Day 14 post\u2010stress, the mice exhibited increased thrombus weight and length, along with harmful alterations in the plasma levels of von Willebrand factor and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin Type 13 motifs. Additionally, arterial protein and/or mRNA levels of PAR\u20102, p\u2010Akt, Bcl\u20102, cleaved caspase\u20103, cytochrome c, gp91phox, TNF\u2010\u03b1, MCP\u20101, ICAM\u20101, VCAM\u20101, and TLR\u20104 were altered, accompanied by arterial endothelial loss.

The control groups received tap water (WT-C, n=5, and HPV-C, n=6), while the treatment groups received either 0.50 mg/ml MSE (WT-50 and HPV-50, n=6) or 0.55 mg/ml MSE (WT-55 and HPV-55, n=5) in drinking water for 28 days. Afterwards, animals were sacrificed, and blood and organs were collected for histopathological and biochemical analysis.ResultsThe main phenolic compounds in MSE were rosmarinic acid and luteolin-O-glucoronide. MSE did not significantly affect weight gain in WT mice; however, WT-55 gained significantly more weight than HPV-55. MSE demonstrated antioxidant activity as indicated by the modulation of hepatic superoxide dismutase and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity, as well as renal GST activity, in MSE-treated HPV groups.

    "content": "Objective:Olanzapine (OLZ) is used by some patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Some of its side effects include weight gain and metabolic syndrome. Zeaxanthin (Zx), a yellow pigment found in egg yolk as well as some yellow and orange plants and fruits, is an anti-obesity factor that aids in the treatment of metabolic disorders. The effects of Zx on metabolic disorders caused by OLZ were investigated in this study.Materials and Methods:Female Wistar rats were randomly divided into seven groups (n=6): 1. control (vehicle); 2. OLZ (5 mg/kg, 14 days, intraperitoneal (i.p.)); 3-5. OLZ + Zx (12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg, 14 days, gavage); 6. OLZ+ metformin (100 mg/kg, 14 days, i.p.); and 7. Zx (50 mg/kg, 14 days). Weight changes were checked every 3 days and food intake was monitored every day. Systolic blood pressure, insulin, blood sugar, triglyceride, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and leptin levels were evaluated on the last day of the study. Results:OLZ caused an increase in weight (84.5% increase on day 15), food intake, blood pressure, triglyceride, LDL, insulin, blood sugar, and leptin compared to the control group (p<0.01 and p<0.001). The use of different doses of Zx (12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg) and metformin decreased weight (the percentages of weigh reduction on day 15 were 91.92% for Zx (50 mg/kg) and 59.39% for metformin), food intake, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride, LDL, insulin, blood sugar, and leptin compared to the OLZ group. The amounts of cholesterol and HDL were not different in different groups. Conclusion:Zx alleviates metabolic abnormalities including hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia in rats.",

IoT mobile applications offer promising solutions for diabetes care by providing real-time monitoring, medication management, and lifestyle support. This paper aims to investigate the potential applications and challenges of IoT mobile applications in managing diabetes among elderly patients. Three databases including Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE were systematically searched; 29 articles were screened in the final analysis process. Key results indicate that the application of mobile apps includes blood glucose monitoring, medication adherence, promotion of physical activity, and dietary control. Devices such as continuous glucose monitors and smart pill dispensers significantly improve glycemic control and medication adherence rates, these technologies enable real-time tracking, personalized feedback, and timely interventions, which enhance self-management and communication with healthcare providers. However, technical challenges like interoperability, data security and privacy, usability and involvement of policymakers pose significant barriers to their effective implementation. Collaborative efforts from healthcare providers, device manufacturers, and policymakers are essential to overcome these barriers and fully leverage the benefits of IoT technologies in diabetic elderly care. This review highlights the need for collaborative efforts to develop standardized frameworks that ensure device compatibility and seamless data integration in IoT solutions for diabetic elderly care, enhance data privacy with advanced technology, and design user-friendly apps for the diabetic elderly to improve the generalization and adoption of IoT IoT mobile applications in healthcare fields for elderly.",

To investigate this association, this comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted.MethodsA systematic electronic search was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from their inception until July 2024 to identify observational studies assessing the relationship between TyG-WC and the risk of NAFLD. Joanna Briggs Institute\u2019s critical appraisal checklist was utilized to evaluate the quality of cross-sectional studies, while the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) score was used to assess cohort studies. The principal summary outcomes included the mean difference (MD) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).ResultsIn total, 10 studies comprising 38,518 participants were included in this meta-analysis, of whom 37% were diagnosed with NAFLD.

However, its association with mortality in cancer survivors remains unclear.MethodsA total of 3,022 cancer survivors from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005\u20132018 were linked to mortality outcomes from the National Death Index (NDI). Weighted Cox proportional hazards models was conducted to investigate the association between NPAR and all-cause, cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was used to clarify the non-linear association. Additionally, analyses for stratification and sensitivity were performed.ResultsDuring a median follow-up of 75\u202fmonths, 790 all-cause deaths occurred, including 244 from cancer and 209 from CVD. After adjustment for covariates, higher NPAR was independently associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR\u202f=\u202f1.09, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.06\u20131.13), cancer mortality (HR\u202f=\u202f1.05, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f0.99\u20131.12), and CVD mortality (HR\u202f=\u202f1.13, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.06\u20131.21). The RCS revealed a U-shaped relationship for all-cause and cancer mortality, with thresholds of 12.76 and 13.60, respectively. Below the threshold, higher NPAR was associated with a reduced risk of mortality (HR\u202f=\u202f0.90, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f0.82\u20130.99; HR\u202f=\u202f0.87, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f0.76\u20130.99), whereas above the threshold, the risk of mortality increased significantly (HR\u202f=\u202f1.14, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.09\u20131.18; HR\u202f=\u202f1.15, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.07\u20131.24). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings.ConclusionThe U-shaped association with all-cause and cancer mortality, along with the linear association with CVD mortality, underscores the potential of NPAR as a valuable prognostic marker in cancer survivors.",

Methods: We analyzed data from 1397 U.S. pregnant women from Infant Feeding Practices Study II. By using a Diet History Questionnaire, pregnant women were asked about the frequency of consumption and portion size of dried beans, chili, and bean soup over the previous month. They also reported the status of GDM. We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine associations between maternal bean consumption and the risk of GDM, adjusting for socio-demographic and pregnancy-related confounders. Results: Mean bean consumption was low among pregnant women: 0.31 cups/week of dried beans, 0.16 cups/week of chili, and 0.10 cups/week of bean soup. Dried bean consumption was relatively high in Hispanic mothers (mean, 0.65 cups/week) and mothers from the East South Central region (0.44). Chili consumption was relatively high in mothers who were Black (0.33), who did not attend college (0.18), who had a household size of 4+ (0.19), whose household income was <USD 25,000/year (0.20), who were WIC recipients (0.18), or who lived in the East South Central region (0.26). Pregnant women who consumed chili one time per month had a lower risk of GDM, compared with never consumers (3.5% vs. 7.4%; confounder-adjusted odds ratio or OR, 0.37 [95% confidence interval or CI, 0.17\u20130.79]; p = 0.011). However, there was no significant association between dried bean (6.6% for one time per week or more vs. 7.0% for never; confounder-adjusted OR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.41\u20131.62]; p-value = 0.569) or bean soup (4.9% for two\u2013three times per month or more vs. 6.6% for never; confounder-adjusted OR, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.05\u20133.08]; p-value = 0.382) consumption and GDM. Conclusions: Bean consumption during pregnancy is low and varies by socio-demographics in the U.S. A moderate frequency of chili consumption may offer some protection against GDM. Replication is needed in larger cohorts with more diverse populations, detailed measures of bean consumption, gold standards of GDM diagnosis, and experimental design. Research in this field can potentially inform dietary approaches to addressing GDM and related morbidities.",

The normal gastrointestinal microbiota plays a specific physiological function in host immunomodulation, nutrient metabolism, vitamin synthesis, xenobiotic and drug metabolism, maintenance of structural and functional integrity of the gut mucosal barrier, and protection against various pathogens. Inflammation is the innate immune response of living tissues to injury and damage caused by infections, physical and chemical trauma, immunological factors, and genetic derangements. Most diseases are associated with an underlying inflammatory process, with inflammation mediated through the contribution of active immune cells. Current strategies to control inflammatory pathways include pharmaceutical drugs, lifestyle, and dietary changes. However, this remains insufficient. Bioactive compounds (BCs) are nutritional constituents found in small quantities in food and plant extracts that provide numerous health benefits beyond their nutritional value. BCs are known for their antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticarcinogenic, anti-metabolic syndrome, and anti-inflammatory properties. Bioactive compounds have been shown to reduce the destructive effect of inflammation on tissues by inhibiting or modulating the effects of inflammatory mediators, offering hope for patients suffering from chronic inflammatory disorders like atherosclerosis, arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of the present review is to summarise the role of natural bioactive compounds in modulating inflammation and protecting human health, for their safety to preserve gut microbiota and improve their physiology and behaviour.",

PAC-As are present in leaves, seeds, flowers, bark, and fruits of many plants, and are thought to exert protective natural roles against microbial pathogens, insects, and herbivores. Consequently, when tested in isolation, PAC-As have shown several biological effects, through antioxidant, antibacterial, immunomodulatory, and antiviral activities. PAC-As have been observed in fact to inhibit replication of many different human viruses, and both enveloped and non-enveloped DNA and RNA viruses proved sensible to their inhibitory effect. Mechanistic studies revealed that PAC-As cause reduction of infectivity of viral particles they come in contact with, as a result of their propensity to interact with virion surface capsid proteins or envelope glycoproteins essential for viral attachment and entry. As viral infections and new virus outbreaks are a major public health concern, development of effective Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Agents (BSAAs) that can be rapidly deployable even against future emerging viruses is an urgent priority.

While a singular, all-encompassing treatment for MetS remains elusive, an integrative approach involving tailored lifestyle modifications and emerging functional food therapies holds promise in preventing its multifaceted manifestations. Our main objective was to scrutinize the efficacy of cranberry proanthocyanidins (PAC, 200 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks) in mitigating MetS pathophysiology in male mice subjected to standard Chow or high-fat/high-fructose (HFHF) diets while unravelling intricate mechanisms. The administration of PAC, in conjunction with an HFHF diet, significantly averted obesity, evidenced by reductions in body weight, adiposity across various fat depots, and adipocyte hypertrophy. Similarly, PAC prevented HFHF-induced hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia while also lessening IR. Furthermore, PAC proved effective in alleviating key risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases by diminishing plasma saturated fatty acids, as well as levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, and non-HDL-C levels. The rise in adiponectin and drop in circulating levels of inflammatory markers showcased PAC\u2019s protective role against inflammation.

Few are downregulated and possess beneficial anti-inflammatory effects. The apolipoprotein M (APOM) is an adipokine whose expression is low during obesity and associated with a metabolically healthy AT. Here, the role of adipose-derived APOM on obesity-associated AT inflammation was investigated by measuring the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in human and mouse models. In 300 individuals with obesity, AT APOM mRNA level was negatively associated with plasma hs-CRP. The inflammatory profile was assessed in Apom\u2212/\u2212 and WT mice fed a normal chow diet (NCD), or a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce AT inflammation. After HFD, mice had a higher inflammatory profile in AT and liver, and a 50% lower Apom gene expression compared with NCD-fed mice. Apom deficiency was associated with a higher inflammatory signature in AT compared with WT mice but not in the liver. Adeno-associated viruses encoding human APOM were used to induce APOM overexpression: in\u00a0vivo, in WT mice AT prior to HFD; in\u00a0vitro, in human adipocytes which conditioned media was applied to ThP-1 macrophages.

The disease processes involved in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are now increasingly established to result in dysregulation of gut microbiota composition and function. Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been associated with poor clinical outcomes and all-cause mortality in patients with ESKD, particularly individuals receiving dialysis. Prior studies highlighted various factors that affect gut microbiota dysbiosis in CKD and ESKD. These include, but are not limited to, uraemic toxin accumulation, chronic inflammation, immune dysfunction, medications, and dietary restrictions and nutritional status. There is a lack of studies at present that focus on the evaluation of gut microbiota dysbiosis in the context of dialysis. Knowledge on gut microbiota changes in this context is important for determining their impact on dialysis-specific and overall outcomes for this patient cohort. More importantly, evaluating gut microbiota composition can provide information into potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Identification of specific microbial signatures may result in further development of personalised treatments to improve patient outcomes and mitigate complications during dialysis. Optimising gut microbiota through various therapeutic approaches, including dietary adjustments, probiotics, prebiotics, medications, and faecal transplantation, have previously demonstrated potential in multiple medical conditions. It remains to be seen whether these therapeutic approaches are effective within the dialysis setting. Our review aims to evaluate evidence relating to alterations in the gut microbiota of patients undergoing dialysis. A growing body of evidence pointing to the complex yet significant relationship which surrounds gut microbiota and kidney health emphasises the importance of gut microbial balance to improve outcomes for individuals receiving dialysis.",

    "content": "Lagopsis supina (Steph. ex. Willd.) Ikonn.-Gal., an ancient Chinese herbal medicine, is traditionally used to treat blood stasis diseases such as myocardial ischemia (MI). However, its pharmacodynamics substances of the anti-MI effect and their potential mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate the pharmacodynamics effects of L. supina against MI and reveal their underlying mechanisms in zebrafish. LSD fraction was screened out for anti-MI active fraction from L. supina by isoprenaline hydrochloride (ISO)-induced zebrafish. It could increase the stroke volume, ejection fraction, and ventricular short-axis systolic rate in the zebrafish model. A total of 30 compounds (Nos. 1\u201330) were isolated and identified from LSD by various chromatographic techniques and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Among them, six compounds, including three lignin compounds (Nos. 15, 16, and 18) and three flavonoid glycosides (Nos. 14, 25, and 26), showed noticeable anti-MI activities, and tiliroside (No. 25) was more active. Molecular docking indicated that tiliroside has a strong binding ability with the proteins KDR, PI3K, Akt, Erk, p38, Bcl-2, Bax, and Caspase3. In the end, the results of RT-qPCR manifested that tiliroside markedly upregulated expression levels of genes kdr, pik3cb, akt2, mapk1, mapk11, mapk14, and bcl-2b and prominently downregulated expression levels of genes bax and caspase3. According to the above results, tiliroside activated the kdr-mediated PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways to exert the anti-MI activity. These discoveries give a scientific basis for applying L. supina in MI treatment and suggest new avenues for developing tiliroside as a candidate for MI therapy.",

Saorilao\u20104 decoction (SRL), a traditional Mongolian prescription, has demonstrated therapeutic effects on PF, though its mechanism of action remains elusive. This study used a bleomycin\u2010induced fibrosis rat model to evaluate SRL's effects by measuring inflammatory factors, assessing fibrosis\u2010related indices, and performing histopathological lung examinations. Serum metabolite levels in the experimental groups were measured using high\u2010performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Data analysis involved principal component and partial least\u2010squares discriminant analyses, followed by functional enrichment analysis of differential metabolites. SRL significantly ameliorated alveolar interstitial injury, fibrosis, and metabolic disorders induced by bleomycin. Additionally, we identified 71 metabolic components related to PF progression, including sphingolipids and fatty acids. Administration of SRL affected 59 metabolic components involved in purine, cysteine and methionine, and arginine and proline metabolisms. Specifically, SRL regulated the levels of hexadecanoic acid, S\u2010adenosylmethionine, 3\u2010oxopalmitoyl coenzyme A, and dodecanoic acid metabolites, thereby improving the metabolic course of PF. In conclusion, this study offers insights into the potential mechanisms of SRL in treating PF from a metabolomics perspective. It provides valuable information for its clinical application.",

Patients with nHIBD are at an increased risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). However, the shared pathogenesis of patients affected with both neurological disorders has not been fully elucidated.PurposeWe here aim to identify the shared molecular signatures between nHIBD and AD. We used an integrated analysis of the cortex gene expression data, targeting differential expression of genes related to the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment following traumatic brain injury.MethodsThe gene expression profiles of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (GSE203206) and that of Neonate Hypoxia-Ischemia Brain Damage (GSE23317) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. After identifying the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and neonate Hypoxia-Ischemia Brain Damage by limma package analysis, five kinds of analyses were performed on them, namely Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis, protein\u2013protein interaction network, DEG-transcription factor interactions and DEG-microRNA interactions, protein-drug interactions and protein-disease association analysis, and gene-inflammation association analysis and protein-inflammation association analysis.ResultsIn total, 12 common DEGs were identified including HSPB1, VIM, MVD, TUBB4A, AACS, ANXA6, DIRAS2, RPH3A, CEND1, KALM, THOP1, AREL1. We also identified 11 hub proteins, three central regulatory transcription factors, and three microRNAs encoded by the DEGs. Protein-drug interaction analysis showed that CYC1 and UQCRFS1 are associated with different drugs. Gene-disease association analysis shows Mammary Neoplasms, Neoplasm Metastasis, Schizophrenia, and Brain Ischemia diseases are the most relevant to the hub proteins we identified. Gene-inflammation association analysis shows that the hub gene AREL1 is related to inflammatory response, while the protein-inflammation association analysis shows that the hub proteins AKT1 and MAPK14 are related to inflammatory response.ConclusionThis study provides new insights into the shared molecular mechanisms between AD and nHIBD. These common pathways and hub genes could potentially be used to design therapeutic interventions, reducing the likelihood of Alzheimer\u2019s disease development in survivors of neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemia brain injury.",

    "content": "Background:\nRacial disparities in educational outcomes persist in the United States, with Black individuals experiencing lower levels of educational attainment and a higher rate of school disciplinary actions compared to their White counterparts. Parental education is a known predictor of offspring educational attainment, but its effects may vary by race. Understanding the role of household income in mediating these effects is crucial for developing targeted policy interventions to reduce educational inequalities.\n\n\nObjectives:\nThis study aimed to examine the role of household income in mediating the differential effects of maternal education on two youth educational outcomes (educational attainment by age 22 and school disciplinary action) in Black and White families.\n\n\nMethods:\nData were drawn from the 22 years of follow-up of the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS), a longitudinal study following a cohort of children born in large U.S. cities between 1998 and 2000. Participants included 1,647 Black and 689 White young adults who were followed from birth to age 22. Maternal education, household income, family structure, and paternal incarceration were assessed at baseline (birth), and two youth educational outcomes, namely educational attainment and any school disciplinary action, were assessed at age 22 (emerging adulthood). Using structural equation modeling (SEM), mediation analysis was conducted to examine whether household income partially mediates the effects of maternal education on youth educational outcomes, with race (Black vs. White) as the moderator.\n\n\nResults:\nThe results indicated that maternal education was positively associated with youth educational attainment and negatively associated with school disciplinary actions in the pooled sample that included both Black and White families. However, the effect of parental education on educational attainment at age 22 was weaker for Black than White families. Household income partially mediated racial differences in the effect of maternal education on youth educational attainment. The results suggest that lower household income in Black families is why we observe a weaker effect of parental education on youth educational attainment for Black youth compared to White youth.\n\n\nConclusions:\nFindings suggest that the lower household income of families is one of the reasons high maternal education levels are associated with lower youth educational attainment in Black than White families. Addressing income disparities through tax policies may help reduce racial disparities in education and promote educational equity for Black youth.",

    "content": "Background/ObjectivesPregnant women were included in the COVID-19 vaccination strategy adopted in Spain in May 2021. We evaluated the obstetric and neonatal symptoms and complications presented by these first pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2, vaccinated and unvaccinated.MethodsA retrospective observational cohort study of 156 pregnant women with a positive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 (infection rate of 4.2%, 156/3719 births), treated at two public hospitals in the Valencian Community (Spain) over two years (2020\u20132022). Of those pregnant women infected, 28.8% (45) had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine before infection. The data were obtained from the digital medical record, the Nominal Vaccination Registry (RNV), and symptom data from the Epidemiological Surveillance Application (AVE) of the CV, supervised by the epidemiology units. We analyzed the symptoms of the disease and the main obstetric and neonatal variables depending on whether or not they were vaccinated with mRNA vaccines.ResultsMost pregnant women were diagnosed in the third trimester of pregnancy (p\u2009=\u20090.003) and reported symptoms associated with the infection (73%), but vaccinated women reported all the symptoms described to a lesser extent, with headache (R1.38, 95%IC 1.15 to 1.66) and vomiting (R 1.38, 95%IC 1.15 to 1.66) statistically significant. All cases of pneumonia occurred in unvaccinated pregnant women who required ventilatory assistance and referral to the Intensive Care Unit. Pregnant women vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 infection had lower rates of gestational pathology, milder symptoms, and fewer postpartum complications than unvaccinated women, although the small sample size did not allow for a significant difference to be seen. Neonatal outcomes were similar in both groups.ConclusionsCOVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women with at least one dose is associated with reduced symptoms, less headache and vomiting, and fewer maternal complications, including pneumonia, which did not occur in the vaccinated cohort. Furthermore, the Apgar score at one and five minutes is higher than 7 in children of immunized mothers.Public health strategies should promote access to vaccines during pregnancy as an urgent priority, to minimize the risk of complications from COVID-19.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12884-025-07630-z.",

    "content": "Immunoglobulin A (IgA), the most abundantly produced antibody at mucosal surfaces, is thought to play key roles in immune responses to respiratory and enteric pathogens and in the regulation of commensal colonization. Low IgA levels have been associated with recurrent infections and immune dysregulation, including inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmunity. Levels of IgA in maternal breast milk and infant stool are both inversely associated with the emergence of immune responses to food antigens in infants and, in naturally resolving food sensitivity and immunotherapy protocols, the induction of IgA antibodies to dietary antigens has been associated with the acquisition of food tolerance. Here, we uncover new roles for IgA in intestinal immune homeostasis utilizing IgA Knockout (KO) mice generated by CRISPR/Cas9. IgA-deficient mice exhibit hyperimmunoglobulinemia, with increased levels of IgE and MCPT-1. The hyperimmunoglobulinemia is associated with dysregulated Tfh/Tfr responses in the Peyer\u2019s Patches (PPs) and spontaneous immunoglobulin production to chow diet. These findings shed light on important interactions between IgA, the mucosal immune system, and the regulation of Tfh responses, emphasizing the importance of IgA in maintaining immune homeostasis at mucosal surfaces.",

Data presented as HR, with a 95% CI. Of 14 studies in patients with ALD outside the liver transplantation (LT) setting, pooled data from 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed that AUD treatment reduces alcohol relapse by 73% (HR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.15\u20130.46) with any treatment and by 77% (HR: 0.23, 95% CI:0.14\u20130.39) with medications in 5 RCTs on 322 (186 intervention) patients. AUD treatment from observational studies was associated with reduced readmission (5 studies) by 48% and decompensation (2 studies) by 52%, but not patient mortality (3 studies). Data showed moderate to high heterogeneity, without publication bias. Analysis of 8 observational studies on LT recipients showed that AUD treatment reduced alcohol relapse in the post-LT period by 59%, with 58% and 60% reduction using integrated and nonintegrated models, respectively. AUD treatment among LT recipients was associated with a reduction in patient mortality by 56% in 3 observational studies, but not in 2 RCTs (HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.38\u20131.79). Pooled data were homogeneous in the analysis of alcohol relapse but showed moderate heterogeneity in analyzing patient mortality.Conclusions:Available data on AUD treatment in patients with ALD improves abstinence and liver-related outcomes both outside and within LT settings. RCTs are needed to examine (a) medications in patients with ALD to examine the benefit of alcohol relapse and patient outcomes and (b) the benefit of integrated multidisciplinary treatment to manage the dual pathology (AUD and liver disease).",

    "content": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, several observational studies proved a certain efficacy of nutraceuticals, herbal products, and other dietary supplements as adjuvant therapies used alongside antiviral drugs. Although their use has not been widespread in Italy, according to preliminary evidence, many supplements with demonstrated immunomodulatory effects, such as vitamins C and D, herbal medicines and essential oils, might relieve the respiratory symptoms of COVID-19, since SARS-CoV-2 can activate inflammasome-mediated inflammatory signaling pathways. Other observational studies have shown that herbal treatments, such as Echinacea purpurea and ginseng, help alleviate respiratory symptoms and reduce serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, which are typically overexpressed in both adult and pediatric SARS-CoV-2 patients. Further, vitamins C and D can attenuate the immune response thanks to their cytokine suppression ability and to their known antimicrobial activity and potential to modulate T helper cell response. The strong immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection is responsible for the severity of the disease. Preliminary data have also shown that L-arginine, an endothelial-derived relaxing factor, is able to modulate endothelial damage, which appears to be one of the main targets of this systemic disease. Finally, some essential oils and their isolated compounds, such as eucalyptol, may be helpful in reducing many of the respiratory symptoms of COVID-19, although others, such as menthol, are not recommended, since it can lead to an undervaluation of the clinical status of a patient. In this narrative review, despite the lack of strong evidence in this field, we aimed to give an overview of the current available literature (mainly observational and cross-sectional studies) regarding herbal products and dietary supplements and their use in the treatment of mild disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Obviously, dietary supplements and herbal products do not constitute a standardized treatment for COVID-19 disease, but they could represent an adjunctive and useful treatment when used together with antivirals.",

This study aims to develop a risk scoring model using longitudinal data to predict the probability of sarcopenia in this population over next 3\u20135\u00a0years, thereby enabling early warning and intervention.MethodsUsing data from a nationwide survey initiated in 2011, we selected patient data records from wave 1 (2011\u20132012) and follow-up data from wave 3 (2015\u20132016) as the study cohort. Retrospective data collection included demographic information, health conditions, and biochemical markers. After excluding records with missing values, a total of 2891 adults with chronic conditions were enrolled. Sarcopenia was assessed based on the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) 2019 guidelines. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with random effects and diverse machine learning models were utilized to explore feature contributions to sarcopenia risk. The Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm was employed to optimize the full Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model and develop an online application tool.ResultsAmong total population, 580 (20.1%) individuals were diagnosed with sarcopenia in wave 1 (2011\u20132012), and 638 (22.1%) were diagnosed in wave 3 (2015\u20132016), while 2165 (74.9%) individuals were not diagnosed with sarcopenia across the study period. MLP model, performed better than other three classic machine learning models, demonstrated a ROC AUC of 0.912, a PR AUC of 0.401, a sensitivity of 0.875, a specificity of 0.844, a Kappa value of 0.376, and an F1 score of 0.44.

    "content": "BackgroundChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is marked by restrictions on airflow, leading to a gradual and irreversible reduction in lung function. This study assessed the predictive value of hematological inflammatory biomarkers, specifically the C-reactive protein-albumin-lymphocyte (CALLY) index and the C-reactive protein to lymphocyte ratio (CLR), for determining COPD risk in United States adults aged 40 and above.MethodsData were sourced from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) covering the period from 2017 to March 2020. The relationship between inflammatory markers, including the CALLY index, CLR, and their components, and COPD was assessed using multivariate logistic regression. Subgroup analyses explored the relationship between the CALLY index, CLR, and COPD, while restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses evaluated potential non-linearity. The predictive performance of these biomarkers for COPD risk was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.ResultsAfter controlling for confounders, for every one-unit increase in the CALLY index (converted to natural logarithm), the prevalence of COPD decreased by 19% (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.71\u20130.92, P = 0.001). Conversely, for every one-unit increase in the CLR (converted to natural logarithm), the prevalence of COPD increased by 23% (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.08\u20131.40, P < 0.001). The linear negative correlation between the CALLY index and COPD was demonstrated by using RCS curves, while the CLR exhibited a positive association. After being fully adjusted, both the CALLY index and the CLR yielded an adjusted area under the curve (AUC) of 0.831 for predicting the risk of COPD, demonstrating excellent predictive capability.ConclusionThe study identifies a linear negative relationship between the CALLY index and COPD, unaffected by potential confounders. A higher CLR is linked to an elevated risk of COPD development. Both the CALLY index and CLR were superior in predicting the risk of developing COPD. Our findings emphasize that the CALLY index and CLR may be a new inflammatory early warning biomarker for COPD.",

    "content": "Peripheral nerve injury disrupts the function of the peripheral nervous system, leading to sensory, motor, and autonomic deficits. While peripheral nerves possess an intrinsic regenerative capacity, complete sensory and motor recovery remains challenging due to the unpredictable nature of the healing process, which is influenced by the extent of the injury, age, and timely intervention. Recent advances in microsurgical techniques, imaging technologies, and a deeper understanding of nerve microanatomy have enhanced functional outcomes in nerve repair. Nerve injury initiates complex pathophysiological responses, including Wallerian degeneration, macrophage activation, Schwann cell dedifferentiation, and axonal sprouting. Complete nerve disruptions require surgical intervention to restore nerve continuity and function. Direct nerve repair is the gold standard for clean transections with minimal nerve gaps. However, in cases with larger nerve gaps or when direct repair is not feasible, alternatives such as autologous nerve grafting, vascularized nerve grafts, nerve conduits, allografts, and nerve transfers may be employed. Autologous nerve grafts provide excellent biocompatibility but are limited by donor site morbidity and availability. Vascularized grafts are used for large nerve gaps and poorly vascularized recipient beds, while nerve conduits serve as a promising solution for smaller gaps. Nerve transfers are utilized when neither direct repair nor grafting is possible, often involving re-routing intact regional nerves to restore function. Nerve conduits play a pivotal role in nerve regeneration by bridging nerve gaps, with significant advancements made in material composition and design. Emerging trends in nerve regeneration include the use of 3D bioprinting for personalized conduits, gene therapy for targeted growth factor delivery, and nanotechnology for nanofiber-based conduits and stem cell therapy. Advancements in molecular sciences have provided critical insights into the cellular and biochemical mechanisms underlying nerve repair, leading to targeted therapies that enhance axonal regeneration, remyelination, and functional recovery in peripheral nerve injuries. This review explores the current strategies for the therapeutic management of peripheral nerve injuries, highlighting their indications, benefits, and limitations, while emphasizing the need for tailored approaches based on injury severity and patient factors.",

    "content": "BackgroundPlacental angiogenesis is particularly important in the treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). Although BACH1 has been implicated in angiogenesis associated with cardiovascular diseases, its specific role and underlying mechanisms in ICP remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the role of BACH1 in ICP.MethodsThe study used clinical samples and two distinct mouse models of ICP to validate BACH1 alterations in ICP through immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), and western blot (WB) analyses. Subsequently, global BACH1-knockout mice were employed to investigate the phenotypic effects of BACH1 deficiency on ICP progression. The molecular mechanisms underlying the regulatory role of BACH1 in ICP were further elucidated using multi-omics approaches (e.g., transcriptomics and proteomics), combined with dual-luciferase reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA).ResultsThe expression of BACH1 was significantly upregulated in ICP, and its expression level positively correlated with clinicopathological indicators of ICP. Experiments using BACH1-knockout mice demonstrated that BACH1 deletion effectively ameliorated ICP-related placental tissue damage and significantly enhanced the expression levels of angiogenesis markers such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Mechanistic investigations indicated that BACH1 deficiency activated the transcriptional expression of solute carrier family 25 member 51 (SLC25A51), thereby promoting the mitochondrial transport of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), restoring mitochondrial function, and improving the activities of electron transport chain complexes I, II, and IV. Notably, BACH1 deficiency promoted taurocholic acid (TCA)-induced proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), whereas this phenotype could be reversed by shRNA-mediated knockdown of SLC25A51. Further studies confirmed that administration of the specific BACH1 inhibitor HPPE effectively alleviated TCA-induced suppression of HUVECs proliferation.ConclusionsBACH1 may suppress placental angiogenesis by inhibiting the transcriptional expression of SLC25A51, making it a potential therapeutic target. Specifically, pharmacological inhibition of BACH1 could provide a targeted therapeutic strategy for placental angiogenesis associated with ICP.Graphical Abstract\nSupplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s10020-025-01215-4.",

New evidence suggests the existence of neural connection from the hippocampus to the hypothalamus that can regulate its function. It could be a new control on the well-regulated hormonal and neural connection to the gonads and hence in reproduction. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of independent lesion of the dorsal or ventral hippocampus in the female rat on the onset of puberty, follicular growth and serum concentration of sex steroid and gonadotropins.MethodsPrepubertal female rats of the CII-ZV strain, 21 days old, were used. Ventral (VH-L) or dorsal (DH-L) hippocampus lesions by the administration of ibotenic acid were performed using stereotaxic surgery. Controls were sham-operated (VH-Sham and DH- Sham), a fifth group was used as absolute control. At 30 days of age all groups underwent novel object recognition tests (NORT).ResultsData from memory using NORT showed a decrease both in short- and long-term memory in the animals in the VH- L and DH-L groups compared to their respective sham-operated controls and the absolute control group. Similarly, injured rats presented delayed vaginal opening and in first vaginal estrus, a decrease in the number of healthy ovarian follicles and an increase in follicular atresia. The ventral or dorsal hippocampus lesions also caused a significant decrease in the secretion of estradiol and progesterone, an increased plasma testosterone. Only DH-L group showed a significant decrease in serum FSH concentrations compared to their respective control groups.DiscussionThese results show for the first time that the hippocampus participates in a stimulatory manner, that could overcome the gonadotropic control by acting by a neural connection to the gonads giving a novel integrative mechanism between learning processes with neuroendocrine mechanism regulating the ovary function.",

While metabolomic analyses of blood, urine, and feces have been explored, results have been inconsistent. Compared to peripheral compartments, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) more closely reflects the chemical composition of brain extracellular fluid. Given that brain dysregulation may be more pronounced during the first episode of psychosis (FEP), we hypothesized that metabolomic analysis of CSF from FEP patients could reveal disease-associated biomarkers. (2) Methods: We recruited 15 patients within 24 months of psychosis onset (DSM-4 criteria) and 14 control participants through the Johns Hopkins Schizophrenia Center. CSF samples were analyzed using both non-targeted and targeted liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry. (3) Results: The non-targeted analysis identified lower levels of N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid in the FEP group, while levels of uric acid were elevated. The targeted analysis focused on indolic and phenolic molecules previously linked to neuropsychiatric disorders. Notably, L-phenylalanine and 4-hydroxycinnamic acid levels were lower in the FEP group, and this difference remained significant after adjusting for age and sex. However, none of the significant differences in analyte levels between the groups survived an adjustment for multiple comparisons.

    "content": "Olive oil, the primary fat source in the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), especially oleic acid, which constitutes 70\u201380% of its composition. Extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), produced by mechanically pressing olives, is the highest quality olive oil, with an intense flavor and acidity <1%. In contrast, refined olive oil (ROO), a blend of virgin and refined oils, contains fewer antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds. EVOO\u2019s health benefits stem largely from its MUFA content, which is linked to reduced risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD), neurodegenerative conditions, and certain cancers. Additionally, EVOO contains minor, but bioactive, components such as polyphenols, tocopherols, and phytosterols, contributing to its oxidative stability, sensory qualities, and health-promoting properties. These include polyphenols, like oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, and tyrosol, which exhibit anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and anticancer effects. Epidemiological studies suggest an inverse relationship between olive oil intake and CVD, with EVOO-enriched MedDiet interventions showing improved lipid profiles, reduced blood pressure, and lower cardiovascular event risk. The PREDIMED study highlights the significant role of EVOO in reducing cardiometabolic risk.

In this article, we demonstrate the physiological mechanisms of the functional ingredients in beer with health-promoting effects, based on the PubMed, Google, CNKI, and ISI Web of Science databases, published from 1997 to 2024. Beer, a complex of barley malt and hops, is rich in functional ingredients. The health effects of beer against 26 chronic diseases are highly similar to those of barley due to the physiological mechanisms of polyphenols (phenolic acids, flavonoids), melatonin, minerals, bitter acids, vitamins, and peptides. Functional beer with low purine and high active ingredients made from pure barley malt, as well as an additional functional food, represents an important development direction, specifically, ginger beer, ginseng beer, and coix-lily beer, as consumed by our ancestors ca. 9000 years ago. Low-purine beer can be produced via enzymatic and biological degradation and adsorption of purines, as well as dandelion addition. Therefore, this review paper not only reveals the physiological mechanisms of beer in overcoming chronic human diseases, but also provides a scientific basis for the development of functional beer with health-promoting effects.",

In this study, we characterized the role of F. proliferatum multicopper ferroxidase (FpfetC), which mediated the oxidization of ferrous to ferric iron in the reductive system of iron assimilation. Deletion of FpfetC led to impaired growth under iron-deprived conditions, and the growth defect could be restored by exogenous iron. Compared to wild-type Fp9 strain, \u0394FpfetC showed increased conidiation, resistance to copper stress, and sensitivity to zinc stress. FpfetC deficiency rendered a transcription remodeling of genes involved in high-affinity iron assimilation, iron homeostasis and iron storage. Moreover, production of fumonisin B1 (FB1) and transcript levels of fumonisin biosynthesis (Fpfums) genes were elevated in \u0394FpfetC. \u0394FpfetC exhibited hypervirulence to rice, accompanied with aggravation of invasive hyphae and activation of siderophore synthesis at the sites of inoculation. Additionally, disruption of FpfetC attenuated penetration ability to cellophane membrane under iron starvation.

Although maternal blood type was found not to be associated with the occurrence of spina bifida, the analysis was never extended to other aspects of the disorder. The purpose of this descriptive study was to determine if maternal blood type was related to characteristics of children with spina bifida. The blood type of 221 mothers of children with spina bifida enrolled on the Arkansas Spinal Cord Disability Registry from 1995 to 2008 was obtained by mailed questionnaire. All children were community-dwelling and from singleton pregnancies. As expected, analysis of mother-child data showed that the distribution of mothers\u2019 blood type was not statistically different from the general population (chi-squared, P = 0.9203). However, the blood type of these mothers was associated with their child\u2019s lesion level (chi-squared, P = 0.011). Mothers with blood type A more frequently had children with thoracic lesions; mothers with non-A blood types more frequently had children with lumbar and sacral lesions. In addition, mean birthweight differed by mothers\u2019 blood type (analysis of variance, P = 0.025). Children of mothers with blood type A had the highest mean birthweight, while those of mothers with blood type AB had the lowest. Also, hydrocephalus was present more frequently in children with thoracic lesions compared to those with lumbar and sacral lesions (chi-squared, P = 0.001). Interestingly, these results were significant for female children but not for male children. In conclusion, maternal blood type was associated with lesion level and birthweight of children with spina bifida.",

One potential mechanism for the effects of environmental factors is through epigenetic modifications that affect gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. However, the functional cooperation between dietary factors and cancer-causing epigenetic regulation is largely unknown. Here, we use a mouse model of age-dependent p16 epimutation, in which the p16 gene activity is directly controlled by promoter DNA methylation. We show p16 epimutation is modulated by folate and cofactors in dietary supplementation, which leads to increased colon cancer risk. Importantly, our findings provide functional evidence concerning the safety of folate fortification in the general population.Significance:Our study demonstrates that dietary folate and cofactors modulate tumor-suppressor gene methylation to increase intestinal tumorigenesis. Our findings highlight the need for monitoring the long-term safety of folate fortification in high-risk individuals.",

All experimental sites included five common treatments: control, traditional farming, optimized practices, and 15 and 30% OFS for chemical nitrogen. The results revealed regional variation in wheat yield; the average wheat yield was 9.06\u202fMg\u202fha\u22121, and the highest yield was 9.58\u202fMg\u202fha\u22121 in the 15%OF treatment. No significant differences in soil micronutrient availability were observed. Compared to the control, the OFS treatments exhibited significant increases in grain Fe (24.69%) and Zn (19.19%) contents. The OFS treatments significantly increased Fe and Zn bioavailability by reducing the PA/Fe and PA/Zn molar ratios. Organic fertilizer substitution also increased micronutrient nutritional yields and reduced the current health burden of Fe and Zn. Under the pessimistic scenario, the OFS treatment reduced health burdens of Zn and Fe deficiencies by 2.38 and 1.31%, respectively, whereas these mitigation efficiencies substantially increased to 7.15 and 3.94% under the optimistic scenario. In conclusion, OFS improved the content and bioavailability of Fe and Zn without affecting yield, which enhanced the nutritional quality of these nutrients, and alleviate the health burden of Fe and Zn deficiency. The findings demonstrate that a 15% organic fertilizer substitution (OFS) optimally enhances wheat grain Fe and Zn bioavailability and nutritional quality while maintaining crop yield, offering region-specific evidence for sustainable agricultural practices to mitigate micronutrient deficiencies and improve human health outcomes.",

Compared to the general population, firefighters have elevated serum levels of some types of PFAS. A randomized clinical trial in Australian firefighters found that routine blood and plasma donation for 1 year led to decreased serum PFAS levels, although health outcomes were not directly measured in that study.ObjectiveIn collaboration with fire service leadership in Arizona, the Firefighter Collaborative Research Project (FCRP) was established to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 interventions in a randomized controlled trial design to reduce serum PFAS levels, reduce cancer and cardiovascular risk, and improve overall health and wellness in US firefighters.MethodsThis study aimed to recruit and enroll up to 1500 active firefighters between August 2023 and October 2024. Between August 2023 and October 2024, active firefighters were recruited and randomized into a study arm based on their eligibility, including serum PFOS levels, for the specific arms. The trial arms include (1) blood and plasma donation, (2) zone 2 physical activity, and (3) intermittent fasting. FCRP outcomes include serum PFAS reduction (arm 1), epigenetic age acceleration (all arms), cardiovascular conditioning (arm 2) and cognitive outcomes (all arms), mental health (all arms), and overall disease risk (all arms). Each study arm includes an intervention and a control group. At enrollment and end of the study, participants provide blood and urine samples and complete a comprehensive questionnaire on their occupational and health history, exposures, and lifestyle behaviors. At the end of the study, participants also participated in a cognitive evaluation. Depending on the study arm, participants may additionally complete a cardiopulmonary exercise test at baseline and follow-up, a mid-study survey, and a mid-study blood and urine collection.ResultsParticipant activities and data collection will conclude by December 2025.ConclusionsThe FCRP is a randomized controlled trial that aims to test the effectiveness of fire service\u2013selected interventions in reducing serum PFAS levels. Study results will contribute to potential interventions that could be used to reduce serum PFAS levels in firefighters.Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT05869747; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05869747International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID)DERR1-10.2196/67120",

    "content": "BackgroundObesity is a threat to public health. Dietary protein and certain amino acids (AAs) have been associated with obesity; however, the association of AAs patterns with excess body weight has not been considered, yet. We aimed to examine the relationship between patterns of AA intake and obesity.MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted on 3197 individuals aged 35 to 70 years. Sociodemographic, medical, physical activity, and anthropometric data were collected. Energy and AAs intake were obtained by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Factor analysis was utilized to determine the AA patterns. Using multiple logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio (OR) of obesity was calculated among individuals categorized into tertiles of the AAs patterns.ResultsIn this study, three AA patterns were identified. The aromatic pattern consists of phenylalanine, tryptophan, proline, glutamic acid, cysteine, serine, and leucine. Five essential AAs plus tyrosine, aspartic acid, arginine, and glycine were the components of the mixed pattern, and finally, the alanine pattern with high loadings for alanine and histidine was the third one. After adjusting for confounders, individuals in the highest tertile (T3) of the aromatic pattern had lower odds of central obesity compared to those in the lowest tertile (T1) (OR\u2009=\u20090.72, 95% CI: 0.58\u20130.89; p\u2009=\u20090.003), whereas this association was not observed in the alanine pattern. On the contrary, general obesity showed a positive association in T3 of the alanine pattern in comparison with T1 (OR\u2009=\u20091.65, 95% CI: 1.02\u20132.67; p\u2009=\u20090.039). Mixed pattern was not associated with any of the obesity types.ConclusionsThe aromatic pattern intake may have an inverse association with central obesity, and following the alanine pattern my contribute to higher odds of general obesity. However, the elaborate relationship between AAs and adiposity warrants further investigation.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s40795-025-01073-7.",

We aimed to investigate the relationship between these plant-based diet indices (PDI, hPDI, and uPDI) and KS in a large group of Iranian adults. This cross-sectional study was carried out on 9,839 adult participants aged 35\u201370 years. Dietary data were collected using a validated semi-quantitative 118-item food frequency questionnaire. The scoring method suggested by Satija et al. was applied to examine the adherence to the PDIs including PDI, hPDI, and uPDI. These indices are grounded in evidence linking plant-based foods to health outcomes such as obesity, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. The history of KS was identified based on self-reported information provided by the participants. Approximately 16.4% (n\u2009=\u20091638) of study participants were found to have KS. After adjustment for a wide range of confounding variables, a significant positive association was observed between PDI and KS (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.01\u20131.37). In the case of hPDI, we found no significant association between hPDI scores and risk of KS after adjustment for potential confounders (OR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.98\u20131.38). Non-significant association was also observed for uPDI and risk of KS in the fully adjusted model (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.95\u20131.35). In conclusion, findings of the present study showed that higher PDI score was positively associated with the risk of KS, whereas the hPDI and uPDI scores were not associated with the risk of KS. Further prospective studies are needed to establish causal relationships.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-98370-9.",

In individuals affected by gout, the condition can progress through the following phases: asymptomatic hyperuricemia, monosodium urate crystal deposition, acute gout, intercritical period, and chronic gout. Two of the following are required to establish the diagnosis of gout: at least two attacks, observation or a history of podagra or the presence of a tophus, and prompt response after starting treatment with colchicine. A 65-year-old man whose acute gout attack presented with a warm, exquisitely tender, erythematous, area of swelling that affected the first metatarsal of his left great toe (podagra) is described. A short oral course of prednisone treatment successfully managed his acute gout attack. His subsequent workup revealed a slightly elevated serum uric acid level and bilateral gout-related bone changes that were demonstrated on the roentgenograms of his feet. Several systemic medications are available for the management of acute and chronic gout and to prevent the recurrence of gout. However, for individuals who cannot tolerate or are unwilling to use these drugs, an approach that incorporates alternative and complementary medicine may be considered. The patient was not able to be treated with the standard systemic medications that are usually used for individuals with gout. He decided to take vitamin C (at a daily dose alternating from 500 mg to 1000 mg) after his acute attack resolved, since vitamin C has been demonstrated to lower serum uric acid levels and reduce the risk of gout. After a follow-up period of nearly one year, he has not had a recurrent acute gout attack. In conclusion, several systemic medications are recommended for the treatment and prevention of gout; however, for those individuals in whom the standard drugs for managing gout are either ineffective or contraindicated, alternative and complementary medicines may be used for the management of gout.",

In recent years, mobile apps have gained popularity as a promising tool to improve medication adherence and self-management in various chronic diseases.ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of mobile apps to improve medication adherence among patients with CKD (including end-stage and renal replacement therapy).MethodsA systematic search was conducted using Scopus, Cochrane, PubMed, and EBSCOhost to include eligible articles that studied mobile apps to improve medication adherence among patients with CKD. The quality of the selected studies was evaluated using the Newcastle\u2012Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.ResultsOut of 231 relevant articles, only 9 studies were selected for this systematic review. Based on Newcastle\u2012Ottawa Scale, 7 were deemed to be of high quality, while others were of fair quality. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool indicated a low to moderate risk of bias across the included studies. Most of the included studies had a randomized controlled design. Of the 9 selected studies, 3 papers represented medication adherence by a coefficient of 10 variability of tacrolimus, 3 papers used adherence measurement scales to calculate the score for assessing medication adherence, 2 papers represented medication adherence by self-reporting, 2 papers represented medication adherence using electronic monitoring, and 1 represented medication adherence by pill count. The mobile apps were identified as Transplant Hero (Transplant Hero LLC), Perx (Perx Health), Smartphone Medication Adherence Saves Kidneys (developed by John McGillicuddy), Adhere4U (developed by Ahram Han), My Dialysis (developed by Benyamin Saadatifar), Kidney Love (developed by National Kidney foundation), and iCKD (developed by Dr Vivek Kumar). Of these apps, 3 focused on evaluating Transplant Hero, while the remaining investigated each of the other mentioned apps individually. The apps use various strategies to promote medication adherence, including reminders, gamification, patient education, and medication monitoring. A majority, 5 out of 9 mobile apps, had a statistically significant (P<.05) effect on medication adherence. There was strong evidence for a positive effect of interventions focusing on games and reminders combined with electronic medication tray monitoring and patient education.ConclusionsMobile apps effectively improved medication adherence in patients with CKD, but low evidence and short intervention duration warrant caution.

Existing studies mainly focus on the environmental effects of their spraying application, while research on their impacts on the soil ecosystem when used as seed-coating agents is relatively limited. Through field experiments, this study systematically evaluated and compared the effects of difenoconazole and imidacloprid seed coatings on wheat rhizosphere soil microbial communities and ecological functions by measuring soil enzyme activities, employing 16S rRNA and ITS high-throughput sequencing technologies and predicting KEGG functional pathways. The results showed that imidacloprid and difenoconazole significantly reduced bacterial community diversity, particularly under the high-dosage difenoconazole treatment (0.18 g a.i./kg seed), with a 5.80% decrease in diversity by day 30. This treatment most strongly inhibited the phyla Bacteroidota and Myxococcota, with maximum reductions of 23.87% and 63.57%, respectively. However, the abundance of Actinobacteriota significantly increased, with a maximum increase of 38.53%. Additionally, fungal community diversity significantly increased under both difenoconazole and imidacloprid treatments. Both seed coatings significantly altered the microbial community structure from days 20 to 60, with recovery occurring by day 120. Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the high-dosage difenoconazole treatment (0.18 g a.i./kg seed) significantly activated functional pathways such as cell motility, signal transduction, and membrane transport, whereas the standard dosage (0.12 g a.i./kg seed) exhibited metabolic suppression. This study elucidates the dynamic impacts of seed-coating agent application on soil microbial communities, providing theoretical support for rational pesticide use and the optimization of agricultural strategies.",

Background: In order to further develop Dixu tea products and improve their flavor, this article studies the effects of different processing methods on the aroma quality of Dixu tea. Methods: A comprehensive analysis of the aroma quality of Diwei tea was conducted using HS-SPME combined with GC-MS and multivariate statistical analysis. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to process the detected volatile substances and an orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model was established. We evaluated the contribution of major compounds in the tea aroma by calculating the odor activity value (OAV). Results: The results showed that a total of 67 compounds were identified. A total of 27 major aromatic volatile compounds (OAV > 1) were screened, and 17 key differential volatile compounds were identified in different tea samples, including octanoic acid, d-citrol, laurene, hexanal, citral, \u03b2-cyclic citral, trans-2-hexenal, \u03b3-nonanolide, \u03b2-ionone, geranylacetone, 1,1,6-trimethyl-1,2-dihydronaphthalene, geraniol, methyl salicylate, linalool, nerolidol, and 7,11-dimethyl-3-methylene-1,6,10-dodecatriene. Combined with the OAV analysis, it is shown that a floral fragrance is a common feature of Guangnan Dixu tea varieties. In addition, white tea also has a fragrant aroma, while black tea, green tea, and bamboo tube tea are all accompanied by a fruity aroma. Conclusions: In summary, processing techniques regulate the aroma characteristics of various types of tea by changing the types and contents of volatile aroma compounds.

    "content": "BackgroundIschemic stroke, accounting for approximately 80% of all stroke cases, is a major public health challenge and a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Current treatments primarily involve thrombolytic therapy, limited to a 4.5-hour window due to the risk of complications, underscoring the need for new therapeutic targets. Systemic inflammation plays a critical role in stroke progression, with immune cells infiltrating the brain and exacerbating damage. B cells, in particular, have been implicated in stroke pathogenesis, although their exact role remains contentious. This study examines anti-CD19 antibody (aCD19 Ab) treatment in a stroke model to determine if CD19+ B cell depletion can reduce infarct size and alleviate inflammation.ResultsThis study investigated whether temporary inhibition of B-cell activity using an aCD19 Ab could alleviate ischemic brain injury in a stroke mouse model by regulating cerebral and systemic immune reactions. Mice subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) exhibited significant reductions in infarct size and brain edema, prolonged post-MCAO survival, and improved behavioral outcomes following aCD19 Ab treatment. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) results revealed a reduction in microvascular endothelial edema, decreased mitochondrial damage in neurons, reduced neuronal apoptosis, and a favorable reconstruction of the cerebral vascular network. Additionally, B cell inhibition reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune cells in the brain and peripheral circulation. The immune response alterations observed in the MCAO/R group were consistent with the trends indicated by stroke patient data.ConclusionsTemporary inhibition of B-cell activity via aCD19 antibody injection alleviated ischemic brain injury in a mouse model of stroke by suppressing systemic immune reactions. Changes in immune cells within the meninges may play a role, and further investigation is needed to understand the mechanisms involved. These findings suggest that cerebral and systemic immune responses contribute to the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, and temporary B cell depletion may represent a potential therapeutic target for stroke therapy.",

The association between NHHR and CVD was assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis (LRA) and the restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis. Also, interaction tests and subgroup analyses were employed to explore whether the associations differ by subgroups. Then, threshold analysis were conducted for interval delineation and detection of threshold effects with two-segment piecewise LR model.ResultsA cohort of 11,471 individuals was involved. The results indicated that the linear relationship between NHHR and CVD was not significant (P for trend >0.05). The RCS analysis revealed a non-linear J-shaped association of NHHR with CVD risk. A two-segment LR model was established to assess the threshold effect of the NHHR. A log-likelihood ratio test (P < 0.001) suggested that the two-segment LR model exhibited better performances compared with the single-line LR model. Additionally, a tangent point of the NHHR occurred at 2.82, and the likelihood of CVD increased by 21% as the NHHR increased by one unit (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.10\u20131.34).ConclusionsA J-shaped association was detected between NHHR and the prevalence of CVD, suggesting that NHHR could serve as a novel assessment marker for identifying high-risk CVD populations.

This study aims to address this gap by assessing the magnitude and determinants of AUB among reproductive-age women in Kombolcha town, Ethiopia, using the 2018 FIGO criteria.MethodsA community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 608 reproductive-age women in Kombolcha town from April 20 to May 20, 2023, using systematic random sampling. Data were collected using interviewer-administered structured questionnaires. The data were entered into EPI Data version 4.6 and analyzed using SPSS version 26. All predictor variables with a p-value <0.25 in bivariable analysis were included in multivariable logistic regression. Variables with a p-value <0.05 in the multivariable analysis were considered statistically significant predictors of abnormal uterine bleeding.ResultThis study found that 36.5% of 591 reproductive-age women experienced abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB). Several factors were significantly associated with AUB: Women in late reproductive age (41\u201349 years) had 4.2 times higher odds of experiencing AUB compared to those in mid-reproductive age (AOR\u2009=\u20094.181, 95% CI: 2.199\u20137.948).

This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of PSMs on mitochondrial health, with particular emphasis on their therapeutic potential. Emerging evidence shows that these metabolites improve mitochondrial function by reducing oxidative stress, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, and regulating key processes such as apoptosis and mitophagy. Mitochondrial dysfunction, a hallmark of many pathologies, including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndrome, has been shown to benefit from the protective effects of PSMs. Recent studies show that PSMs can improve mitochondrial dynamics, stabilise mitochondrial membranes, and enhance bioenergetics, offering significant promise for the prevention and treatment of mitochondrial-related diseases. The molecular mechanisms underlying these effects, including modulation of key signalling pathways and direct interactions with mitochondrial proteins, are discussed. The integration of PSMs into therapeutic strategies is highlighted as a promising avenue for improving treatment efficacy while minimising the side effects commonly associated with synthetic drugs. This review also highlights the need for future research to elucidate the specific roles of individual PSMs and their synergistic interactions within complex plant matrices, which may further optimise their therapeutic utility.

    "content": "Mango anthracnose is a major biotic stress that limits mango production worldwide. An integrated transcriptome, small RNA (sRNA), and degradome sequencing analysis was conducted to determine the complex molecular mechanisms of mango anthracnose resistance. The transcriptome sequencing of 12 samples from a mango anthracnose resistant genotype under control and stress conditions on the 3rd and 5th day post inoculation identified 3,462 and 8,341 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively, which were mainly involved in transcription factor activity, defense response, an obsolete oxidation\u2009\u2212\u2009reduction process, and flavonoid biosynthetic processes. The sRNA sequencing of the samples identified 372 known and 104 novel miRNAs. A total of 81 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, of which three were differentially expressed at both the 3rd and 5th day post-inoculation (dpi), including ath-MIR166e-p5_1ss15AC, mtr-miR156e, and csi-miR3954_L\u2009+\u20091_2ss17CG21CT. According to degradome sequencing, 2,274 targets were predicted for 341 miRNAs. The combined analysis of transcriptome and sRNA sequencing identified 257 miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs. In these pairs, csi-miR3954_L\u2009+\u20091_2ss17CG21CT was up-regulated at both the 3rd and 5th dpi under stress, which could cleave multiple sites of an NAC gene (LOC123212502) that was down-regulated under stress. Overall, these miRNAs and genes provide a molecular foundation for the miRNA-mediated response to mango anthracnose stress and can be regarded as promising candidates for mango improvement.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12864-025-11631-9.",

    "content": "BACKGROUNDThe correlation conclusions between self-management, frailty, and quality of life (QoL) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients are inconsistent.AIMTo comprehensively assess the current status of self-management, psychological cognitive impairment, and QoL in elderly patients with COPD.METHODSConvenient sampling was employed to select 312 elderly patients with COPD who were receiving treatment in the respiratory and critical care medicine department of a tertiary grade A hospital from November 2023 to February 2024. The study utilized demographic information and clinical characteristics, self-management behavior, occurrence of psychological cognitive impairment, and QoL as evaluated through general information questionnaires, the COPD patient self-management scale, simple frailty scale, simple mental status scale, clinical dementia assessment scale, and the clinical COPD assessment test questionnaire. This research aims to describe the current status and correlations among self-management behavior, cognitive impairment occurrence, and QoL.RESULTSThe average score for self-management behavior in elderly COPD patients was 136.00 (119.00, 164.50), indicating a moderate level overall. There were 98 cases of cognitive impairment, accounting for 31.4%, with a mental status score of 3 (2, 3.75). The average QoL score was 24 (19, 28), indicating a low level. Additionally, there was a negative correlation between total self-management behavior score and cognitive impairment occurrence (r = -0.589, P < 0.001), and QoL total score (r = -0.409, P < 0.001). Cognitive impairment occurrence was positively correlated with QoL total score (r = 0.345, P < 0.001). Disease course and self-management behavior score were independent factors affecting the total QoL score in elderly COPD patients (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONThe self-management behavior of elderly patients with COPD is at a moderate level. However, the occurrence of cognitive impairment is high and significantly influenced by disease course, level of self-management, and mental status. The QoL is low, emphasizing the urgent need to intervene in the self-management behaviors of elderly COPD patients, actively reduce the occurrence of cognitive impairment, and mitigate the impact of the disease on QoL.",

    "content": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common pregnancy complication closely associated with maternal oxidative and antioxidant imbalance, known as oxidative stress. Environmental and dietary exposure plays an important role in inducing oxidative stress during pregnancy. This review aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the role of oxidative stress induced by environmental and dietary exposure in GDM while incorporating current research frontiers. Environmental pollution, smoking, excessive nutrition, and unhealthy eating habits such as a high-fat diet and vitamin deficiency, may contribute to the generation and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidative stress. Within the pathway of oxidative stress in GDM, the production and clearance mechanisms of ROS play a pivotal role. Relevant studies have demonstrated that ROS production is closely linked to insulin resistance, adipose tissue accumulation, inflammation, and other pathological processes. Antioxidant substances like vitamins C and E or glutathione can mitigate oxidative stress damage on pregnant women and fetuses by scavenging ROS. Currently, there remain several cutting-edge issues regarding the involvement of the oxidative stress pathway in GDM pathogenesis as well as its relationship with environmental and dietary factors, for instance: how to reduce maternal oxidative stress levels through dietary adjustments or lifestyle modifications; how antioxidant substances can be utilized for intervention treatment; and accurate assessment methods for maternal oxidative stress status along with its association with GDM risk. In conclusion, environmental and dietary factors exert significant influence on GDM pathogenesis while highlighting increasing attention toward understanding the role played by the oxidative stress pathway within this context. In-depth research endeavors within this field are anticipated to offer novel insights into prevention strategies as well as therapeutic approaches for GDM.",

    "content": "Aortic aneurysms are potentially fatal focal enlargements of the aortic lumen; the disease burden is increasing as the human population ages. Pathological oxidative stress is implicated in the development of aortic aneurysms. We pursued a chemogenetic approach to create an animal model of aortic aneurysm formation using a transgenic mouse line, DAAO-TGTie2, that expresses yeast d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) under control of the endothelial Tie2 promoter. In DAAO-TGTie2 mice, DAAO generated the ROS hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in endothelial cells only when provided with d-amino acids. When DAAO-TGTie2 mice were chronically fed d-alanine, the animals became hypertensive and developed abdominal, but not thoracic, aortic aneurysms. Generation of H2O2 in the endothelium led to oxidative stress throughout the vascular wall. Proteomics analyses indicated that the oxidant-modulated protein kinase JNK1 was dephosphorylated by the phosphoprotein phosphatase DUSP3 (dual specificity phosphatase 3) in abdominal, but not thoracic, aorta, causing activation of Kruppel-like Factor 4 (KLF4)-dependent transcriptional pathways that triggered phenotypic switching and aneurysm formation. Pharmacological DUSP3 inhibition completely blocked the aneurysm formation caused by chemogenetic oxidative stress. These studies establish that regional differences in oxidant-modulated signaling pathways lead to differential disease progression in discrete vascular beds and identify DUSP3 as a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of aortic aneurysms.",

In young mice, peripheral blood telomere length was significantly elongated following oral intake of D-WP for 4 weeks. mRNA expression of both telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and telomerase RNA component (TERC) was significantly increased in the peripheral blood following oral intake of D-WP for 4 weeks. In aged mice, peripheral blood telomere length was significantly decreased as compared with that of young mice, and significantly restored to the level of young mice drinking water by the oral intake of D-WP for 4 weeks. The mRNA expression of peripheral blood TERT and TERC mRNA in aged mice significantly decreased as compared with the level in young mice drinking water, and was significantly restored to the level of expression of young mice drinking water by oral intake of D-WP for 4 weeks.

An extract encapsulated by spray drying with whey protein, pure extract, and pure whey protein were comparatively tested. The main compounds identified via HPLC-DAD analysis underwent in silico ADME assessment. The spasmolytic effect was tested on a model of spontaneous rat ileum contractions, and the mechanism of action was further evaluated on acetylcholine-, KCl-, CaCl2-, BaCl2-, histamine-, N(\u03c9)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester-, and glibenclamide-modified contractions. The most abundant compounds were secoiridoids (dominantly gentiopicroside), followed by C-glycosylated flavonoids and xanthones. Both pure and encapsulated extracts achieved significant spasmolytic effects, despite the spasmogenic activity of pure whey protein. The extract may exert its spasmolytic effect through multiple pathways, predominantly by antagonizing the Ca2+ channel and opening the K+ channel, while the nitric oxide pathway appears not to be involved. The antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the pure extract were moderate. The extract stabilized by encapsulation retained all of the tested bioactivities of the unencapsulated extract. The obtained results suggest that G. asclepiadea has potential for use in the treatment of some gastrointestinal complaints and that the encapsulated extract could be a valuable functional ingredient in pharmaceutical and food products.",

    "content": "BackgroundAnxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental health conditions, characterized by excessive fear, tension, avoidance behaviors, and heightened threat perception. Approximately 1 in 14 individuals meets the diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder. Flavonoids, bioactive compounds found in fruits, vegetables, and tea, possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. However, evidence on the relationship between flavonoid intake and anxiety risk remains limited. This study examines the association between flavonoid intake and anxiety risk and explores the effects of specific flavonoid subclasses.MethodsThis study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Individual flavonoid intake was assessed using two-day 24-hour dietary recalls, and anxiety status was evaluated through a standardized anxiety questionnaire. To assess the relationship between flavonoid intake and anxiety risk, weighted logistic regression analysis was performed. Additionally, restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was employed to evaluate potential nonlinear associations. We conducted subgroup analyses for flavonoids that showed significant associations in the logistic regression, including theaflavin-3-gallate, total flavones, total flavanones, total isoflavones, and naringenin. These analyses aimed to explore the moderating effects of demographic characteristics such as sex, age, marital status, smoking status, and body mass index (BMI).ResultsWe analyzed data from 1,637 participants in the NHANES. Significant differences were observed between the anxious and non-anxious groups in age, poverty-income ratio (PIR), BMI, smoking status, marital status, education level, and flavonoid intake. The anxious group had higher age (47.12 vs. 42.81 years, P\u2009<\u20090.0001), PIR (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), and BMI (P\u2009=\u20090.01). They also had a higher proportion of females, unmarried individuals, and current smokers (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Logistic regression analysis showed that genistein, petunidin, naringenin, apigenin, and total flavones were significantly associated with reduced anxiety risk (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Subgroup analysis confirmed protective effects in males, married individuals, participants with General Educational Development (GED)-level education, and specific ethnic groups. RCS analysis suggested nonlinear relationships, with total flavones, total flavanones, and naringenin showing protective effects at low intake levels (P\u2009<\u20090.05). All models demonstrated good fit (P\u2009<\u20090.001).ConclusionFlavonoid intake is inversely associated with anxiety risk, particularly Theaflavin-3-gallate, Total Flavones, Total Flavanones, Total Isoflavones, and Naringenin.

    "content": "Detailed research analysis of the contents of eight toxic trace elements in non-cereal flours was conducted using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and the release of elements from the flour matrixes after in vitro digestion was investigated. It also examines dietary intake and evaluates the metal pollution index. The highest digestibility value was measured with banana flour (92.6%), while grape seed flour was the least digestible, only 44%. The most abundant element was Al, followed by Ni, which was present (except banana flour) at concentrations of more than twice that found in food generally. The flax and milk thistle seed flours showed two orders of magnitude higher amounts of Cd than those measured in other flours. When consuming a 100 g portion of non-cereal flours, a consumer weighing 60 kg is exposed to the highest dietary exposures to Al and Ni (in the order of \u00b5g/kg bw); the exposures for the intake of Cd, Sn, Hg, As, Ag, and Pb are of the order of ng/kg bw. Grape seed flour was assessed as a significant contributor to the provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) value of Al (16%); in addition, significant contributions of banana, pumpkin, grape, and milk thistle flours to the PTWI value of Hg, ranging from 15 to 22%, were determined. Furthermore, the contributions of milk thistle and flax seed flours to the provisional tolerable monthly intake (PTMI) value of Cd were also recognized as significant (specifically, 26 and 49%, respectively). The contributions of milk thistle, flax seed, and pumpkin seed flour to tolerable daily intake for Ni were estimated between 19 and 57%. The margin of exposure values for developmental neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and cardiovascular effects obtained for the intake of Pb were considered safe. During the digestion process, the toxic elements that were the most retained in the matrices of grape and pumpkin seed flour were easily released from the banana flour. The retention factor, which was above 50% for Hg in the grape seed flour, was examined as the highest. All toxic trace elements, which were found to still be part of the undigested portion of the flours, could theoretically pass into the large intestine. In the future, more research is needed to clarify the possible carcinogenesis effect of toxic trace elements in the colon.",

The black mulberry extract showed a significant capacity to inhibit the accumulation of lipid droplets, reducing by 50.40\u00a0% the fat deposits. The extract was able to reverse the deleterious effects of excess glucose in C. elegans enhancing stress resistance, preventing the accumulation of lipofuscin, and decreasing the ROS production. The anti-glycation and antioxidant effects in vitro were higher than the reference substances aminoguanidine and quercetin respectively.

    "content": "Background/Objectives: The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of bisphenol A (BPA) exposure on neurobehavioral testing in young Wistar rats and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Thymus ciliatus (TEO) essential oil to attenuate the damage induced by this chemical toxin. Methods: The essential oil was extracted by hydro-distillation (yield of 2.26%), and the characterization by GC-MS indicates that the major components of Thymus ciliatus oil are thymol (63.33%), p-cymene (13.4%), and \u03c3-terpinene (6.69%). Acute BPA intoxication was induced with a dose of 50 mg/kg orally for 60 days. The neurobehavioral evaluation, performed using a comprehensive set of tests including the forced swim test, dark/light box, Morris water maze, open field test, and sucrose preference test, clearly demonstrated that bisphenol A (BPA) exposure induced significant neurobehavioral impairments. Results: These impairments included reduced exploratory behavior indicative of heightened stress, anxiety, and depressive-like states, as well as deficits in memory and learning. Furthermore, BPA intoxication was associated with metabolic disturbances such as hyperglycemia along with histopathological evidence of brain tissue damage. However, TEO treatment attenuated these adverse effects by restoring neurobehavioral function. Molecular docking analysis revealed an affinity between the major essential oils identified in T. ciliatus, BPA, and the 5HT2C receptor and the MAO, AChE, and BChE enzymes, suggesting a potential mechanism underlying BPA\u2019s effects on behavior and memory. In addition, TEO also showed an interaction with these molecules, suggesting a therapeutic potential against BPA. These findings underscore the promising role of TEO in mitigating the poisonous effects of BPA and pave the way for additional research into the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic uses of natural bioactive compounds for the prevention and treatment of toxic diseases. Thymol, the major compound in TEO, exhibited activity related to the dopamine and serotonin pathways, so it could have potential antidepressant properties. Conclusions: Thymol might be a promising candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative and neurological disorders such as depression, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease while also preventing histological damage in the brain.",

    "content": "Food digestion in the gastrointestinal is a series of processes consisting of chemical and physical digestion. Recently, developing foods with controlled digestion in the stomach may attract more attention. Hydrogel foods are useful tools for designing foods with controlled digestion because it is relatively easy to design their food characteristics by adjusting the type and content of the additives. This review introduces the latest status of in vitro gastric digestion as a food characterization system. The in vitro evaluation of chemical gastric digestion by gastric acid and digestive enzymes focuses on INFOGEST-standardized gastrointestinal digestion protocols for healthy adults, infants, and older adults. For the in vitro evaluation of physical gastric digestion by peristalsis, the current development of gastrointestinal tract devices that precisely or efficiently simulate the shape of the stomach and gastric peristalsis is described. In addition, we introduce studies that have utilized these devices to investigate the gastric digestion behavior of hydrocolloid foods with different mechanical characteristics.",

D. gallinae also acts as vector and reservoir of different viral and bacterial pathogens such as, E. coli, S. enteriditis, P. multocida, S. gallinarum, Newcastle disease, Avian influenza, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Eastern, Western and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis viruses. Some of them are important from zoonotic point of view like, S. enteritidis, Borrelia burgdorferi and avian influenza A virus. It also causes gamasoidosis in humans. For its control various acaricides have been used, but because of D. gallinae resistance against these chemicals, and environmental issues related to these acaricides have encouraged research into different alternatives. One of them are plant extracts and phytochemicals that play a major role by offering a promising option for permanent pest control because of their bioactive abilities. Important phytochemicals that are most effective against these mites are phenol, flavonoid, terpenoid, tannin, and phenylpropanoids. That give their effects by creating neurotoxicity, digestive and metabolic disruption, cuticle disruption, oxidative stress, cell membrane damage, respiratory inhibition, and hormonal disruption in these mites. This review explains the significance of various plant extracts, their phytochemicals and their methods of application against D. gallinae infestations in poultry. Different types of plant's active metabolites have acaricidal, repellent and growth inhibitory effects such as tannins, phenols, terpenoids, and flavonoids. The mode of action, effectiveness and toxicity of these extracts are also discussed. This review also discusses zoonotic importance of D. gallinae.",

Protein electrophoresis showed that ginger juice could hydrolyze \u03b1s-, \u03b2-, and \u03ba-casein. Curd formation was initiated at 90 s, marked by significant changes in intensity detected via intrinsic fluorescence. The contents of soluble protein and calcium decreased rapidly during coagulation, while the caseinolytic activity, storage moduli, loss moduli, hardness, adhesiveness, and water-holding capacity increased, resulting in a denser gel structure with smaller pores and fewer cavitations as observed by scanning electron microscopy. Electronic tongue analysis indicated that milk could neutralize the astringency and saltiness of ginger juice, rendering the taste of ginger-juice milk curd more akin to that of milk. Approximately 70 volatile components were detected in ginger-juice milk curd. \u03b1\u200d-Zingiberene, \u03b1\u200d-curcumene, \u03b2\u200d-sesquiphellandrene, and \u03b2\u200d-bisabolene were the predominant volatile flavor compounds, exhibiting an initial decrease in content followed by stability after 90 s. Decanoic acid, \u03b3-elemene, and caryophyllene were identified as unique volatile compounds after mixing of milk and ginger juice. Understanding the dynamic changes in these characteristics during coagulation holds significant importance for the production of ginger-juice milk curd.",

In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that traditional Chinese medicine (CM) has a wide range of applications in regulating the immune system and treating CHD. This article reviewed the role of CM in the regulation of IL-17-regulated macrophages, discussed the core components and targets of CM in the treatment of CHD, and laid a theoretical foundation for its clinical application. The results show that CM can effectively inhibit the formation of foam cells, stabilize vulnerable plaque and delay the progression of atherosclerosis by inhibiting inflammation, regulating the polarization of macrophages and promoting cholesterol outflow. In addition, CM can also regulate the expression and signaling pathway of IL-17, further inhibit inflammatory response and improve the symptoms of CHD, providing a new idea and method for the prevention and treatment of CHD.",

Periaqueductal gray (PAG) is the key region for the regulation of pain and depression. Puerarin (Pue) is a natural isoflavone compound that has a neuroprotective effect, but the mechanisms on the comorbidity of chronic pain and depression remain unclear. In this study, the spared nerve injury (SNI) produced mechanical allodynia and depressive-like behaviors and elevated the neurological damage in ventrolateral (vl) PAG. Meanwhile, at the 8 weeks following injury, mitochondrial dysfunctions including the dysregulated protein levels, the decreased Mn-SOD activity and the reduced ATP contents were observed in vlPAG of SNI model mice. Pue administration improved mechanical pain, motor coordination, and depression-like behaviors, decreased the neuronal activity and neuroinflammation, and elevated the mitochondrial function in vlPAG. Database analysis and experimental assay showed that Pue bound with Bax at the affinity of 2.4 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM via D102 residue, and decreased Bax level in vlPAG of mice and in primary astrocytic cells. In addition, Pue also recovered levels of mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species, and decreased inflammation in primary astrocytic cells. These results suggest that Pue improves the comorbidity of chronic pain and depression by targeting Bax and reducing mitochondrial dysfunction in vlPAG. This study may provide a theoretical basis for Pue application in improving the comorbidity of chronic pain and depression.",

Methods: We investigated the cortical activation pattern of 57 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 67 healthy controls (HCs) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during prepared walking (PW) and single walking (SW) tasks. The study focused on assessing brain activity in four regions of interest (ROIs): the prefrontal cortex (PFC), primary motor cortex, secondary motor cortex, and parietal lobe. Additionally, we examined the behavioral performance\u2014gait speed\u2014during the tasks, analyzed variations in cortical activation intensity, and conducted correlation analyses between Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores, gait speed, and oxygenation levels. Results: There was no significant difference in gait speed between patients with MCI and HCs. The MCI group exhibited lower activation in the primary motor cortex, secondary motor cortex, and parietal regions compared to HCs during the motor execution stage of PW (q < 0.05, FDR-corrected). Additionally, activation in the primary (r = 0.23, p = 0.02) and secondary motor cortices (r = 0.19, p = 0.04) during the motor execution stage of PW correlated significantly with MoCA scores. Furthermore, brain activity in the PFC (r = 0.22, p = 0.02), primary motor cortex (r = 0.22, p = 0.01), secondary motor cortex (r = 0.20, p = 0.02), and parietal lobe (r = 0.19, p = 0.03) during the motor preparation stage of gait was positively correlated with gait speed.

Whilst in some cases a curative measure, this highly toxic intervention consistently scores poorly on quantitative measures of tolerability and safety. Of these side effects, cardiac and microvascular defects pose the greatest health risk and are the leading cause of death amongst cancer survivors who do not succumb to relapse. In fact, in many low-grade cancers, the risk of recurrence is far outweighed by the cardiovascular risk of morbidity. As such, there is a pressing need to improve outcomes within these populations. Polyphenols are a group of naturally occurring metabolites that have shown potential vasoprotective effects. Studies suggest they possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, in addition to directly modulating vascular signalling pathways and gene expression. Leveraging these properties may help counteract the vascular toxicity induced by chemotherapy. In this review, we outline the main mechanisms by which the endothelium is damaged by chemotherapeutic agents and discuss the ability of polyphenols to counteract such side effects. We suggest future considerations that may help overcome some of the published limitations of these compounds that have stalled their clinical success. Finally, we briefly explore their pharmacological properties and how novel approaches could enhance their efficacy while minimising treatment-related side effects.",

Elevated TMAO concentrations have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality, highlighting its significance as a potential biomarker for adverse health outcomes. Given these associations, it is hypothesized that lifestyle interventions, such as healthy dietary patterns and exercise, could reduce TMAO concentrations. The aim of this systematic\u2013narrative hybrid literature review was to evaluate the relationship between various lifestyle interventions and TMAO. Methods: MEDLINE (via PubMed\u00ae), Scopus\u00ae, and grey literature were searched until July 2024 for eligible clinical trials. Case reports, case series, case studies and observational studies were excluded, as well as studies that investigated food products, nutraceuticals, dietary supplements or have been conducted in the pediatric population. Results: In total, 27 studies were included in this review. While some dietary interventions, such as plant-based, high-dairy, very low-calorie ketogenic diet or the Mediterranean diet, were associated with lower TMAO concentrations, others\u2014including high-protein and high-fat diets\u2014were linked to an increase in TMAO concentrations. Studies that incorporated a combination of nutrition and exercise-based intervention presented neutral results. Conclusions: The relationship between dietary interventions and TMAO concentration remains controversial.

The negative effects of solar exposure on the skin have been amply demonstrated and there is an urgency for the development of alternative photoprotective approaches. In this respect, natural extracts represent the most interesting and promising source. Among them, Aspalathus linearis extracts appear to be an excellent candidate due to supporting evidence, their multiple beneficial biological effects, and their robust toxicological profile. Here, we first explored the photoprotective properties of two different Aspalathus linearis extracts (fermented and unfermented) individually, and then in combination, in a simplified model assessing Normal Human Dermal Fibroblast survival after UVB radiation. Surprisingly, we found the fermented extract to be more photoprotective than the unfermented one. In addition, a specific combination of the two extracts showed a synergistic effect. By HPLC and FRAP analyses, we observed that the photoprotective effect did not correlate with the amount of Aspalathus linearis main characteristic metabolites nor with the antioxidant capacity of the ingredients. Finally, an additional photoprotective effect was observed when Aspalathus linearis extracts were combined with a Polypodium leucotomos extract (Fernblock\u00ae), a well-known botanical ingredient with demonstrated photoprotection activities. Thus, this work provides a solid scientific basis for the inclusion of this technology in future topical and systemic photoprotective strategies.",

The first (A) stage used 25 male mice divided into five groups. On day (d)1, the body weight (BW) of the mice was weighed. On d2\u201311, 5-mg/gBW sucrose was given by gavage, and then, on d12, BW and blood glucose level of mice were determined. On d13, 0.52-mg/gBW glibenclamide was given in A2, 0.39-mg/gBW FE3H was given in A3, and 0.52-mg/g BW FE3H was given in A4 by gavage. Control, A0, was only given double-distilled water (DDW). On d14, BW and blood glucose levels of the mice were determined. The second (B) stage used 24 male mice divided into six groups. On d1, B1\u2013B5 were injected intraperitoneally 5-mg/kg BW HgCl2; then, on d3\u20135, they were given by gavage 0.2-mg/g BW Immunos\u00ae in B2, 0.39-mg/gBW FE3H in B3, 0.52-mg/gBW FE3H in B4, and 0.65-mg/gBW FE3H in B5. Controls, B0 and B1, were only given DDW. On d6, the mice were killed by cervical dislocation. The weight of the kidney was determined, and then, the urea and creatinine levels were measured in blood samples from the heart.Results:FE3H contains 98.92 \u00b1 12.88 \u00b5g/g quercetin. Sucrose tends to increase BW, and then, 0.39-mg/g BW FE3H treatment tends to restore BW close to control. Sucrose significantly increased blood glucose, and then, 0.39- and 0.52-mg/gBW FE3H treatment restored significantly blood glucose similar to control. HgCl2 increases kidney weight, and then, 0.65-mg/gBW FE3H treatment tends to restore kidney weight close to control. HgCl2 significantly increased urea and creatinine, and then, 0.52- and 0.65-mg/gBW FE3H treatment significantly restored urea and creatinine similar to the control.Conclusion:FE3H, which is high in flavonoid quercetin, has the potential to restore hyperglycemia by 47.38%\u201348.18%, uremia by 29.04%\u201333.06%, and hypercreatininemia by 49.52%\u201354.28% in mice.",

Several studies have examined the impact of date consumption during pregnancy on the outcome of labor, providing useful results.Objective: This study aims to determine the effects of date fruit consumption on the onset and progression of labor.Methods:The study included 120 pregnant women who were pregnant at GAK Sarajevo, in the period from 01.01. 2020 to 31.12. 2020. The patients were divided into two groups, the first group of 60 patients who consumed 6 dates during the last four weeks of pregnancy, and the second group of 60 patients who did not consume dates during pregnancy.Results:There was a significant positive effect of consuming date fruits on maternal outcomes in the first and third stages of labor. The group of pregnant women who consumed dates had a shortened latent phase of labor, which meant that their cervix reached maximum dilation (10 cm) faster. Pregnant women in this group gave birth 8.5 hours faster than pregnant women who did not consume dates, in whom labor lasted about 15 hours. Of the 60 pregnant women in the first group, 60% had a spontaneous natural birth, and only 40% of the patients received oxytocin, because dates enhance the effect of oxytocin, which is responsible for uterine contractions.Conclusion:This study showed a promising effect of consuming date fruits on the duration of the stages of labor.

DOBS was calculated based on 16 pro- and antioxidant nutrients using two 24-hour dietary recalls. Logistic regression models and 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) were employed to assess the association between DOBS and self-reported history of MI, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and lifestyle covariates. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) models were used to evaluate potential nonlinear relationships.ResultsA one-point increase in DOBS was associated with a 3% lower odds of MI in both unadjusted and fully adjusted models (adjusted OR\u2009=\u20090.97, 95% CI: 0.95\u20130.99).

While formal tests for nonlinearity were not significant, RCS curves suggested a threshold effect with diminishing benefits at higher DOBS levels. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the findings.ConclusionHigher DOBS is associated with a lower likelihood of MI among diabetic patients. These findings highlight the potential value of antioxidant-rich dietary patterns in cardiovascular risk assessment. However, given geographic and cultural variability in diet, further validation is needed in diverse populations and prospective study settings.",

Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (FUT2 rs1047781, rs601338, FUT3 rs28362459, rs3745635, ST6Gal-I rs2239611 and MGAT5 rs34944508) were detected by the MassARRAY System. The association between these SNPs and the risk of lung cancer, clinicopathological characteristics, and combined effect of behavioral factors (areca nuts, cigarettes, alcohol) and genotypes on lung cancer were estimated using by logistic regression analysis.ResultsIn this study, individuals with AA genotype in ST6Gal-I rs2239611 significantly increased lung cancer risk (ORadj\u2009=\u20092.077; 95%CI:1.191\u20133.624; Padj\u2009=\u20090.010), particularly in smokers (Padj\u2009=\u20090.038) and alcohol consumers (Padj\u2009=\u20090.049). FUT2 rs1047781 was associated with clinical stage (Padj\u2009=\u20090.047) and lymph node metastasis (Padj\u2009=\u20090.014). Significant gene-environment interactions were observed between behavioral factors (cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, and betel quid chewing) and both FUT2 rs1047781 (Padj\u2009=\u20090.013) and ST6Gal-I rs2239611 (Padj\u2009=\u20090.047), collectively elevating lung cancer risk.ConclusionST6Gal-I rs2239611 was a potential genetic biomarker for lung cancer. Areca nut chewing, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking interacts with glycosyltransferase gene polymorphisms (FUT2 rs1047781 and ST6Gal-I rs2239611), increasing lung cancer risk\u2014a novel finding given the lack of prior studies on this combination.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12885-025-14088-x.",

    "content": "Lung cancer, particularly non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with cisplatin-based chemotherapy being a standard treatment. However, the development of chemoresistance significantly limits its efficacy, necessitating alternative therapeutic approaches. Here, we demonstrate the anticancer effects of the extracts of Allium\u00a0pseudojaponicum\u00a0Makino (APE), a salt-tolerant plant, in cisplatin-resistant NSCLC. Metabolite profiling using UPLC-Q-TOF-MSE identified 13 major compounds, predominantly alkaloids (71.65%) and flavonoids (8.81%), with key bioactive constituents such as lycorine (29.81%), tazettine (17.22%), and tricetin (8.19%). APE significantly inhibited cell viability in A549 and H460 cells, reducing viability to 38.6% (A549-Ctr), 37.2% (A549-CR), 28.4% (H460-Ctr), and 30.4% (H460-CR) at 40 \u00b5g/mL after 48 h. APE also suppressed colony formation by over 90% in both 2D and soft agar assays, while showing no cytotoxicity in normal human keratinocytes up to 80 \u00b5g/mL. Flow cytometry analysis revealed APE-induced G1 phase arrest, with the G1 population increasing from 50.4% to 56.6% (A549-Ctr) and 47.5% to 58.4% (A549-CR), accompanied by reduced S phase populations. This effect was associated with the downregulation of G1/S transition regulators, including cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin E, and CDK2. Furthermore, proteomic analysis identified STAT3 signaling as a major target of APE; APE decreased phosphorylated STAT3 and c-Myc expression, and STAT3 knockdown phenocopied the effects of APE. These findings highlight the potential of APE as a natural product-based therapeutic strategy for overcoming cisplatin resistance in NSCLC.",

    "content": "Insulin resistance (IR) is a metabolic disorder characterized by an impaired response to insulin. This condition is associated with excess adiposity and metabolic inflammation, contributing to an increased risk for related chronic diseases. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can affect genes related to metabolic pathways which are related to IR and the individual response to nutrients and dietary patterns, affecting metabolic inflammation and insulin sensitivity. This narrative review explores the current evidence on interactions between genetic variants and dietary factors, specifically their effects in modulating IR and metabolic inflammation. A comprehensive search of the literature was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science, and a total of 95 articles were reviewed. The key findings reveal that SNPs in the TCF7L2, ADIPOQ, and TNF genes significantly influence metabolic responses and modulate the effects of the Mediterranean diet on biomarkers of inflammation and IR. Genotype-dependent variations in IR and inflammation biomarkers were observed in the response to different diets for SNPs in the TCF7L2, ADIPOQ, and TNF genes. Additionally, polygenic risk scores (PRSs) can also predict the response to the intake of nutrients and specific diets, and offer a promising tool for assessing genetic predisposition to IR. This review underscores the pivotal role of an individual\u2019s genetic background in the effects of their nutrient intake and in the responses to dietetic interventions, thereby laying the foundation for personalized and effective nutritional strategies tailored to each individual\u2019s necessity in mitigating IR and its associated risk factors for chronic diseases.",

The present review specifically focuses on the Mediterranean diet (MD) as a whole dietary pattern, and on its peculiar components, such as n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), polyphenols and fiber. We explored their potential benefits in a spectrum of both systemic and organ-specific autoimmune disorders, including rheumatic diseases (like rheumatic arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus), and thyroid diseases (like Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis), since they often occur in the same individuals.

They were instructed to perform controlled breathing, including calm, shallow, deep, and alternating deep and shallow breathing patterns. We employed functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate disparities in the effects of multiple breathing patterns on the brain. Meanwhile, we captured the participants\u2019 facial expressions and vital signs.ResultsThere were significant variations in the effects of four breathing patterns on functional connectivity between brain regions, facial expressions, and vital signs. The four breathing patterns impacted six brain regions. Among them, alternating deep and shallow breathing had a particularly pronounced effect, and there was robust functional connectivity in different brain regions. Additionally, this breathing pattern elevated autonomic nervous system activity, which contributed to achieving a more tranquil state. Furthermore, alternating deep and shallow breathing had a more positive influence on the changes in oxyhaemoglobin concentration (\u0394 [HbO2]) of the brain compared with deep breathing.DiscussionAlternating shallow and deep breathing could enhance emotional stability, improve autonomic nervous system function, and promote brain functional connectivity. Our findings unveiled distinct effects of diverse breathing patterns on both the brain and mood state, establishing a theoretical foundation for respiratory rehabilitation training for stroke patients.",

The obtained HSCG and CSCG extracts contained mainly chlorogenic acid derivatives, according to liquid chromatography\u2010mass spectrometer chromatogram. The glycation process was performed by using bovine serum albumin (BSA)/ glucose system with 3\u2009weeks incubation. In the presence of HSCG and CSCG extracts at 250\u2009\u03bcg/mL, after thermal treatment (pasteurization and sterilization) and in\u00a0vitro digestion, the glycation process through the fructosamine, AGEs, and amyloid cross \u03b2 structure formation was monitored, and these extracts exhibited an anti\u2010glycation property at early and advanced stages after pasteurization and in\u00a0vitro digestion compared to no thermal treatment. However, at high temperature of sterilization, the suppress of anti\u2010glycation property had resulted and were related with the amount of antioxidant and the ability of antioxidant scavenging as presented in a dose manner. The calculated % caffeine bio\u2010accessibility of HSGC extracts was 65.8%, 64.8%, and 52.4% in non\u2010thermal, pasteurized, and sterilized samples while the higher bio\u2010accessibility was found in CSCG sample as of 67.4, 66.6, and 63.1, respectively. A high correlation of TPC values, thermal treatments and in\u00a0vitro digestions with the AGEs was detected.

    "content": "Background: The enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) has been a focal point in neurodegenerative diseases research, particularly in relation to Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This is attributed to the significantly reduced levels of cholinergic neurons observed in Alzheimer\u2019s patients compared to healthy individuals. The strategy to mitigate the onset of these diseases in patients lies in the exploration of new potential AChE inhibitors with a focus also on natural extracts. A rapid and specific capillary electrophoresis method with direct ultraviolet detection (CZE-UV/Vis) was developed to screen natural extracts by assessing their potential to inhibit AChE. Materials and Methods: To enhance the specificity when analysing complex matrixes such as natural extracts, a sequential analysis approach based on the \u201csandwich model\u201d was implemented using Ellman\u2019s reagent [5,5\u2032-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)] (DTNB) as a colorimetric indicator. Results: A reference inhibitor, neostigmine, was used for system validation through IC50 and Ki values determination by subsequent injections of acetylthiocholine substrate in the presence of neostigmine at increasing concentrations, and the enzyme combined with DTNB in borate-phosphate buffer (30 mM, pH 8.0). The enzymatic product was selectively detected at 412 nm. The validated system was applied to the analysis of seven natural extracts. Conclusions: Results demonstrated promising outcomes for identifying phytotherapeutic agents with potential applications in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. This method provides high selectivity and automation, offering a streamlined and effective approach for screening natural matrices containing potential AChE inhibitors.",

    "content": "ABSTRACTThe increasing demand for sustainable agricultural practices prompts a reevaluation of feeding strategies in ruminant nutrition. Agricultural waste, often viewed as a by\u2010product (BP), presents a promising opportunity to enhance the sustainability of livestock production systems. This review explores the potential of incorporating various agricultural BPs into ruminant diets. Utilizing these BPs reduces the environmental impact of livestock farming and contributes to the circular economy by recycling nutrients back into the food system. The nutritional composition of these wastes varies widely, and their inclusion in ruminant diets improves feed efficiency, animal performance and overall health. Research indicates that specific treatments, such as fermentation and ensiling, enhance the digestibility and nutrient availability of these materials. Moreover, incorporating agricultural waste into ruminant nutrition leads to financial benefits for farmers by reducing reliance on conventional feed sources. However, key challenges remain, particularly the need for further research to optimize inclusion rates and address potential anti\u2010nutritional factors found in some agricultural wastes. Notably, adding these materials to ruminant diets results in 10%\u201330% reductions in feed costs and improvements of 5%\u201320% in key performance metrics, such as weight gain and milk production. These findings highlight the economic and sustainability benefits of utilizing agricultural BPs in livestock feeding practices. This review emphasizes the necessity of developing innovative and sustainable feeding strategies that leverage agricultural waste, calling for interdisciplinary approaches that combine animal nutrition, agronomy and environmental science. By adopting these practices, the livestock sector contributes to food security while minimizing its ecological footprint. Future research focuses on innovative processing techniques, effective management of anti\u2010nutritional factors, and assessing long\u2010term impacts on animal health and productivity. Additionally, examining the nutritional and health aspects of commonly used BPs, such as pomegranate, grape, pistachio, saffron, raisin, olive and tomato, is essential for fully understanding their potential in ruminant nutrition and guiding the development of targeted feeding strategies.",

Despite advances in pharmacological treatments, there remains no cure or method to reverse the disease. This paper highlights the role of psychological stress as a critical yet underappreciated risk factor for cognitive decline and reviews its complex interplay with behavioral, social, and biological mechanisms. Chronic psychological stress drives physiological and behavioral changes that are linked to accelerated cognitive deterioration, particularly in older adults. Early interventions can target stress management and behavioral prevention strategies, which include physical activity, healthy diet, and social engagement. Further, key barriers to meaningful policy change to prevent and slow ADRD include lack of public awareness, stigma around mental health and aging, and misaligned funding incentives. Policy initiatives can improve brain health literacy, increase equitable access to services, and enhance community-level and environmental factors to promote healthy aging. Prioritizing stress reduction and promoting early detection and prevention can meaningfully reduce ADRD risk and progression, improving public health broadly.",

    "content": "ABSTRACTNatural flavonoids are regularly consumed orally and are known to possess antioxidant, anti\u2010inflammatory, and analgesic properties. Yet, there is limited understanding of the role of organic functional groups in imparting these properties. This review paper suggests that several organic functional groups, including the hydroxyl, methoxy, glycosyl, prenylated, and flavonoid groups, play crucial roles in determining the antioxidant, anti\u2010inflammatory, and analgesic abilities of flavonoids. Of particular significance is the contribution of the prenylated group, which notably enhances the anti\u2010inflammatory and analgesic abilities of flavonoids. Among isoflavones, the prenylated groups are primarily situated at C6. Despite their importance, prenylated flavonoids have not received sufficient attention from researchers. Another crucial class of organic functional groups is glycosyl groups, with C3 being a key substitution site among anthocyanins because monosaccharides are commonly found at this position. Conversely, the presence of trisaccharides or a combination of disaccharides and monosaccharides within flavonoids appears to impede their anti\u2010inflammatory and analgesic properties. Additionally, the majority of biflavonoids, excluding polymerized flavanols, demonstrate either anti\u2010inflammatory or analgesic abilities. C8 holds paramount importance among flavanols as the main substitution site for flavonoid substitution. Examination of the significance of substitution sites in flavanones, flavonols, flavones, and chalcones, which possess antioxidant, anti\u2010inflammatory, and analgesic abilities, revealed the importance of total substitution with diverse organic functional groups. Insights from this review can provide the guiding light to the discovery of flavonoids with antioxidant, anti\u2010inflammatory, and analgesic abilities in the future.",

Cryptosporidium is a common cause of gastroenteritis. Cryptosporidiosis is common in HIV\u2010infected individuals.ObjectivesThe objective of the review was to assess the efficacy of interventions for the treatment and prevention of cryptosporidiosis among immunocompromised individuals.Search methodsWe searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to August 2005: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, AIDSLINE, AIDSearch, EMBASE, CINAHL, Current Contents, Geobase, and the Environmental Sciences and Pollution Management.Selection criteriaRandomised controlled trials that compared the use of any intervention to treat or prevent cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised persons were included. The outcome measures for treatment studies included symptomatic diarrhoea and oocyst clearance.Data collection and analysisTwo reviewers independently assessed the trials for quality of randomisation, blinding, withdrawals, and adequacy of allocation concealment. The relative risk for each intervention was calculated using a random effects model.Main resultsSeven trials involving 169 participants were included. There were 130 adults with AIDS enrolled in five studies. Evidence of significant heterogeneity was present. There was no evidence for a reduction in the duration or frequency of diarrhoea by nitazoxanide (RR 0.83 (95% CI 0.36\u20101.94)) and paramomycin (RR 0.74 (95% CI 0.42\u20101.31)) compared with placebo. Nitazoxanide led to a significant evidence of oocyst clearance compared with placebo among all children with a relative risk of 0.52 (95% CI 0.30\u20100.91). The effect was not significant for HIV\u2010seropositive participants (RR 0.71 (95% CI 0.36\u20101.37)). HIV\u2010seronegative participants on nitazoxanide had a significantly higher relative risk of achieving parasitological clearance of 0.26 (95% CI 0.09\u20100.80) based on a single study. The single study comparing spiramycin with placebo found no significant difference in reduction of the duration of hospitalisation (mean difference \u20100.40 days (95% CI \u20106.62\u20105.82)) or in mortality between the two arms of the trial (RR 0.43 (95% CI 0.04\u20104.35)). One study assessed the role of bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract, reporting a relative risk for decreased stool frequency of 0.19 (95% CI 0.03\u20101.19), while another compared bovine hyperimmune colostrum with placebo and found no evidence for improvement of stool volume (RR 3.00 (95% CI 0.61\u201014.86)) or in oocyst concentration per ml of stool (RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.02\u20103.74)). No studies were found that assessed prevention.Authors' conclusionsThis review confirms the absence of evidence for effective agents in the management of cryptosporidiosis. The results indicate that nitaxozanide reduces the load of parasites and may be useful in immunocompetent individuals. Due to the seriousness of the potential outcomes of cryptosporidiosis, the use of nitaxozanide should be considered in immunocompromised patients. The absence of effective therapy highlights the need to ensure that infection is avoided. Unfortunately, evidence for the effectiveness and cost\u2010effectiveness of preventive interventions is also lacking.",

Recent studies highlight the important role of dietary factors, including the use of flavonoids, in improving liver health. These compounds possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and liver-protective properties. Flavonoids have been shown to affect the gut microbiota, which plays a key role in liver function and disease progression. Therefore, their role in preventing the development and progression of MAFLD through modulation of the microbiome seems to be of interest. This narrative review aims to consolidate the current evidence on the effects of selected flavonoids on MAFLD progression, their potential mechanisms of action, and the implications for the development of personalized dietary interventions for the management of liver disease.",

    "content": "Metabolic-Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD) is a clinical\u2013pathological scenario that occurs due to the accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes which is considered a significant cause of liver conditions and contributes to an increased risk of death worldwide. Even though the possible causes of MAFLD can involve the interaction of genetics, hormones, and nutrition, lifestyle (diet and sedentary lifestyle) is the most influential factor in developing this condition. Polyphenols comprise many natural chemical compounds that can be helpful in managing metabolic diseases. Therefore, the aim of this review was to investigate the impact of oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the role of polyphenols in managing MAFLD. Some polyphenols can reverse part of the liver damage related to inflammation, oxidative stress, or mitochondrial dysfunction, and among them are anthocyanin, baicalin, catechin, curcumin, chlorogenic acid, didymin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, luteolin, mangiferin, puerarin, punicalagin, resveratrol, and silymarin. These compounds have actions in reducing plasma liver enzymes, body mass index, waist circumference, adipose visceral indices, lipids, glycated hemoglobin, insulin resistance, and the HOMA index. They also reduce nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), blood pressure, liver fat content, steatosis index, and fibrosis. On the other hand, they can improve HDL-c, adiponectin levels, and fibrogenesis markers. These results show that polyphenols are promising in the prevention and treatment of MAFLD.",

Sugar cane juice is a particularly beneficial beverage, and its waste products are crucial for treating numerous illnesses. As compared to traditional treatments, zinc-doped carbon quantum dots (Zn/CQDs) are easy-to-prepare, economically invested, high nutritive value and environmentally safe substance.Materials & methodsThis study investigated the hepatoprotective effects of zinc-doped carbon quantum dots (Zn/CQDs) against carbon tetrachloride (CCl\u2084)-induced liver injury in male Wistar albino rats. Zn/CQDs were synthesized using a microwave-assisted method and characterized using FTIR and XRD techniques. Meanwhile, a liver Cirrhosis model induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) was utilized to determine the inhibitory effects of sugar cane juice mixed with Zn/CQDs against liver Cirrhosis. Biochemical parameters, including AST, ALT, and uric acid, were measured to assess liver function. Histopathological analysis was performed to examine liver tissue damage.ResultsIn this study, Zn/CQDs were extended from 1.62 to 5.45\u00a0nm. The results demonstrated that Zn/CQDs exhibited significant hepatoprotective effects by reducing liver enzyme levels and mitigating histopathological changes. However, the study also highlighted the need for further optimization of the used vehicle delivery method, such as sugarcane juice, which is showed a marginal impact on liver function. Sugar cane juice with Zn/CQDs decreased aspartate amino transferase levels (AST) and improved the uric acid concentration. It means a protection from the toxins effect by controlling the liver enzyme levels; but also, elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) indicate ongoing liver injury. Overall, this study provides future insights into the potential of sugar cane juice with Zn/CQDs as a high nutritive value additive to drinks and food; it is investigated for plants waste as a novel green therapeutic strategy for liver diseases. Further research is necessary to explore the underlying mechanisms of action and to optimize their formulation for clinical applications.ConclusionOverall, this study provides promising insights into the potential of Zn/CQDs as a novel green therapeutic strategy for liver diseases.",

The degradation of habitats resulting from agricultural development and deforestation poses a considerable risk to the accessibility of these vital plants. This research was conducted in the Fofa and Toba sub-districts of the Yem Zone in Central Ethiopia, aiming primarily to explore and record the medicinal plant species that indigenous communities use for treating various health issues in both people and livestock.MethodsThis study was carried out between March 2023 and April 2024, involving a total of 96 informants, with 12 selected from each kebele. A range of quantitative methodologies were employed in the research, such as the informant consensus factor (ICF), fidelity level (FL), plant part value, preference ranking, and direct matrix ranking. Furthermore, various statistical analyses including independent t-tests, one-way ANOVA, correlation, and regression were performed using R to evaluate and compare the ethnobotanical knowledge among different groups of informants.ResultsA total of 164 medicinal plant species from 140 genera and 60 families were identified in the study. Of these species, 67.68% were utilized for human ailments, 19.5% for livestock issues, and 12.8% for both. The sources of these medicinal plants included 81 species from wild areas, 35 from home gardens, 23 from agricultural fields, 15 from living fences, and 10 from roadsides. In terms of growth forms, herbs comprised the largest group with 76 species, followed by trees with 42 species, shrubs with 34 species, and climbers with 9 species. The most commonly used plant parts were leaves, followed by roots. Preparations were primarily made by crushing the plants, with other methods including powdering, chewing, smashing, and boiling. The highest informant consensus factor value of 91% indicated a significant healing potential for respiratory diseases, common colds, coughs, and fevers. Notably, A. sativum (for malaria) and H. rueppelii (for abdominal pain) recorded the highest fidelity level values. Additionally, the average number of medicinal plants reported by participants varied significantly across different demographic factors, including gender, age groups, educational levels, and experience (P\u2009<\u20090.05).ConclusionThe study area is home to a wide variety of potential medicinal plants along with valuable indigenous knowledge. To address the growing anthropogenic threats and safeguard these plants and their associated knowledge, it is essential to adopt effective conservation strategies and promote responsible use. Additionally, the medicinal properties of these plants should be scientifically validated to harmonize local knowledge with modern medicine effectively.",

Many medicinal plants are recognized for their anticancer properties and may offer ways to mitigate the adverse effects of conventional cancer treatments. In this study, the potential of Ziziphus mucronata methanol extract as a kinase inhibitor was assessed using the MTT assay, a universal kinase assay, and a human phosphokinase antibody array, along with a GC-MS analysis of volatile anticancer compounds. The MTT assay revealed strong cytotoxicity in A549 cells, with an IC50 of 31.25 \u00b5g/mL, while HeLa cells showed weaker cytotoxicity with an IC50 of 125 \u00b5g/mL. In comparison, paclitaxel exhibited potent inhibitory effects on A549 cells (IC50 of 31.25 \u00b5g/mL) and moderate inhibition on HeLa cells (IC50 of 65 \u00b5g/mL). Enzyme activity, measured by ADP production in the ADP-Glo assay, indicated that the extract inhibited protein kinase activity in both A549 and HeLa cells after 24 h of treatment. Additionally, the human phosphokinase antibody array, which includes 44 pre-spotted kinases, showed that the extract downregulated multiple phosphorylated kinases in both cell lines. Some of the affected kinases, such as TOR, Fyn, HcK, Fgr, STAT5b, PLC-\u03b31, p38\u03b1, ERK1/2, AMPKA, Akt1/2, GSK-3\u03b1/\u03b2, MSK1/2, CREB, RSK1/2/3, PLC-\u03b31, and STAT5a are critical regulators of various cellular processes, including apoptosis, differentiation, and proliferation.

Although crucial in fibrotic diseases, the association between endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and ferroptosis remains incompletely elucidated. Herein, increased levels of heat shock protein family A member 5 (HSPA5), acting as a co-molecular in ERS and ferroptosis, along with EMT-associated alterations, including increased \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and Col1a1 levels and decreased E-cad expression, were observed in fibrotic kidneys of Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction (UUO)-induced mouse models and TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in HK-2 cells. The employment of ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) improved these alterations and reversed TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in vitro. More importantly, Inhibiting ERS by Tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDCA) reversed the alterations of ferroptosis, including GPX4 expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, iron overload, increased lipid peroxidation production, as well as EMT progression in vivo and in vitro. Whereas the overexpression of HSPA5 strikingly attenuated the inhibitory effects of TUDCA on ferroptosis and TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in vitro. Mechanistically, Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) tests showed that ATF4 engaged with and SUMOylated HSPA5 to trigger the HSPA5 signaling pathway in response to TGF-\u03b2.

The triterpenoids, designated as ginsenosides, are increasingly recognized as drug-like molecules in cancer therapies due to their therapeutic role in restricting tumor invasion, proliferation, metastasis, apoptosis, and drug resistance reversal in tumor cells. In the nanobiotechnological era, nano-delivery systems provide feasible solutions to address bottlenecks associated with traditional drug delivery methods (low bioavailability, instability in the gastrointestinal tract, high dosage requirements, side effects, poor absorption, and incomplete drug utilization in the body). The dedicated efforts for precise and effective treatment have directed the development of ginsenoside-based nano-delivery systems to achieve potent anticancer efficacies and address the limitations in ginseng pharmacokinetics, facilitating drug development trials. Studies into ginseng pharmacokinetics showed a remarkable prolonged clearance and free drug levels of ~15% (ginsenoside RB1 nanoparticles) in mice (compared to only ~5% for ginsenosides) and better antitumor efficacies, demonstrating key success in ginseng biotechnology for drug development.

There has been no comprehensive research on the biological activity of this plant to demonstrate its role in maintaining oral health. Given the compounds previously isolated from this species, this study aims to predict which extracts among the four solvents are responsible for promoting oral health.MethodThe phytochemical content and antioxidant activity of the leaves, stem, and stem bark extracted with four different solvents were evaluated using standard methods. The EC50 of the extracts was tested with the DPPH assay, and the silicon content of the stem was determined by a gravimetric method. The antibacterial activity was tested using an agar well diffusion method at different test concentrations of (mg/ml) crude extracts and MIC/MBC were determined using the microdilution method. Physicochemical and ADME properties were determined using the SwissADME online server. PASS online was used to predict biological activities related to the oral health of the compounds previously isolated from the plant.ResultsThe antioxidant activity, in terms of EC50, of the leaves of S. subserrata was comparable to that of the standard reference, ascorbic acid. The silicon content in the stem extract of the plant was found to be 0.24%. The leaves of S. subserrata exhibited higher levels of total phenolic and flavonoid contents compared to other parts of the plant. Hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate extracts of S. subserrata were found to be active against the Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecalis) which are known to be responsible for foodborne infections. Among the previously reported compounds from S. subserrata, catechin, quercetin, saligenin, catechol, gallocatechin, salicin, and triandrin were found to be predicted for the strong antioxidant, anti-infection, and anti-mucositis activities.ConclusionAll phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activity results underscore the significance of plants traditionally used as chewing sticks.

    "content": "Background/Objectives: The most used antipyretic and pain relief treatment is paracetamol (acetaminophen), also known as N-acetyl-para-aminophenol (APAP). However, it is considered potentially hazardous if consumed repeatedly in large doses or over prolonged periods. This investigation explores the effectiveness of hesperidin (Hesp) and Hesp loaded on layered double hydroxide nanoparticles (Hesp-NPs) in inhibiting the progression of acute hepatotoxicity in rats induced by APAP. Methods: LDH-Hesp-NPs were prepared and characterized. Male Wistar rats were orally treated with Hesp and Hesp-NPs at the same adjusted dose (100 mg/kg) every other day for six weeks. After 2 h of the first doses of Hesp and Hesp-NPs, the rats received one oral dose of APAP (750 mg/kg). Results: Administering of Hesp and Hesp-NPs to APAP-treated rats significantly reduced oxidant parameter (malondialdehyde) and serum enzymes (ALT, AST, LDH, and ALP) associated with liver function. Antioxidant markers in the liver, such as catalase and glutathione, also increased notably. Moreover, Hesp and Hesp-NPs enhanced the mRNA expression of liver UGT1A6, IL-10, and HO-1. Conversely, the mRNA expressions of liver CYP1A1, KEAP1, TGF-\u03b2, P53, and BAX decreased. These improvements in biochemical and molecular markers were corroborated by liver histopathology. Conclusions: Hesp and Hesp-NPs protect significantly against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in male Wistar rats. Hesp-NPs treatment was more potent. The protective effects may be mediated via modulation of APAP biotransformation, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.",

    "content": "Although silk-derived biomaterials have garnered attention for environmental remediation due to their sustainability, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, the application of silk fibroin-based microparticles (FNP) for pollutant dye adsorption remains vastly underexplored. Hence, this study pioneers the fabrication and characterization of FNP for the removal of methylene blue (MB), offering a comprehensive comparison with two other silk-based states of raw silk cocoon pieces (SC) and sericin-degummed silk fibers (SD). Remarkably, FNP achieved an adsorption capacity of 122.98 mg g\u22121, over 32-fold higher than both SC and SD (3.8 mg g\u22121), highlighting its superior efficiency. The adsorption performance of FNP was strongly influenced by experimental variables including pH, contact time, initial dye concentration, and adsorbent dosage. Structurally, FNP exhibited favorable physicochemical properties for adsorption, including uniform spherical morphology (\u223c2.45 \u03bcm), moderate surface area (21.894 m2 g\u22121), a mesoporous-to-macroporous structure (pore diameter 21.911 \u00c5), and a point of zero charge (pHpzc) of 6.7, contributing to its effective electrostatic interactions with the cationic dye MB. Importantly, the adsorption data fitted the Dubinin\u2013Radushkevich isotherm, indicating a chemisorption-dominated mechanism. Molecular docking further revealed specific fibroin-dye interactions at Lys62 (hydrogen bonding, \u22120.2 kcal mol\u22121) and Glu94 (ionic bonding, \u22121.9 kcal mol\u22121). Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations in water confirmed the docking results and demonstrated the aqueous stability of the fibroin-MB complex.

    "content": "ABSTRACTUveal melanoma (UM) is an aggressive intraocular malignancy. Despite effective control of primary tumors, ~50% of UM patients develop metastases, with the liver being the predominant secondary site. BAP1 deficiency, present in ~80% of metastatic UM cases, is strongly associated with increased metastatic risk and poor prognosis. In silico analysis of UM patient samples suggests that reduced BAP1 is linked to enhanced expression of genes involved in fatty acid processing; therefore, we hypothesize that BAP1 deficiency primes UM cells for survival in the hepatic microenvironment by enhancing lipid tolerance and oxidative stress responses. Our findings demonstrate BAP1\u2010mutant UM resist lipotoxicity, whereas BAP1\u2010competent UM exhibit sensitivity due to lipid peroxide accumulation\u2014a hallmark of ferroptotic\u2010like stress, and a response that can be mitigated by ferroptosis inhibition. Using an ex\u00a0vivo liver slice model, we found that disrupting lipid metabolism with atorvastatin, an HMG\u2010CoA reductase inhibitor, reduced tumor burden of BAP1\u2010mutant UM. Moreover, we demonstrate a positive correlation between BAP1 and an epigenetic regulator of lipid homeostasis, ASXL2. Notably, ASXL2 depletion in BAP1\u2010competent UM phenocopies the lipotoxicity resistance observed in BAP1\u2010mutant UM\u2014an effect that may be mediated by altered PPAR expression. This study reveals a novel mechanism linking BAP1 expression to lipid sensitivity via ASXL2, providing insights into liver tropism and potential therapeutic avenues for metastatic uveal melanoma.",

    "content": "Objective:\nFatty Acid Desaturase 1 (FADS1) is a rate-limiting enzyme controlling the bioproduction of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Increasing studies suggest that FADS1 is a potential cancer target. Our previous research has demonstrated the significant role of FADS1 in cancer biology and patient survival, especially in kidney cancers. We aim to explore the underlying mechanism in this study.\n\n\nMethod and results:\nWe found that pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of the expression of FADS1 significantly reduced the intracellular conversion of long-chain PUFAs, effectively inhibits renal cancer cell proliferation, and induces cell cycle arrest. The stable knockdown of FADS1 also significantly inhibits tumor formation in vivo. Mechanistically, we showed that while FADS1 inhibition induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, FADS1 expression is augmented by ER-stress inducer, suggesting a necessary role of PUFA production in response to ER stress. FADS1-inhibition sensitized cellular response to ER stress inducers, leading to cell apoptosis. Also, FADS1 inhibition-induced ER stress leads to activation of the PERK/eIF2\u03b1/ATF4/ATF3 pathway. Inhibiting PERK or knockdown of ATF3 rescued FADS1 inhibition-induced ER stress and cell growth suppression, while ATF3-overexpression aggravates the FADS1 inhibition-induced cell growth suppression and leads to cell death. Metabolomic analysis revealed that FADS1 inhibition results in decreased level of UPD-N-Acetylglucosamine, a critical mediator of the unfolded protein response, as well as impaired biosynthesis of nucleotides, possibly accounting for the cell cycle arrest.\n\n\nConclusion:\nOur findings suggest that PUFA desaturation is crucial for rescuing cancer cells from persistent ER stress, supporting FADS1 as a new therapeutic target.",

There was no evidence for redox imbalance or oxidative cellular injury in the absence of metabolic stress. In mice with \u03b2-catenin\u2013deficient hepatocytes, ethanol intoxication led to significant redox imbalance in the hepatocytes and further deterioration in mitochondrial functions that included reduced OXPHOS, fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and ATP production. Feeding these mice ethanol significantly increased liver steatosis and oxidative damage, compared with wild-type mice, and disrupted the ratio of NAD+ to NADH. \u03b2-catenin\u2013deficient hepatocytes also had showed disrupted signaling of Sirt1/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR-\u03b1) signaling.\n\n\nConclusions:\n\u03b2-catenin has an important role in the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis, regulating ATP production via the TCA cycle, OXPHOS, and FAO; \u03b2-catenin function in these systems is compromised under conditions of nutrient oxidative stress.

The aim of the study is to evaluate how much a diet practiced in southern Italy is associated to a risk of mortality. The study population included 2472 participants first investigated in 1985, inquiring about their frequencies of intake of 29 foods using a self-administered questionnaire covering the previous year. The population was followed up for mortality until 31 December 2017. Cox-based risk modeling referred to single foods, food groups, the results of principal component analysis (PCA), and a priori indexes. Single food analysis revealed eggs, fatty meat, and fatty/baked ham to be inversely associated with mortality. Furthermore, one of the 5 PCA derived dietary patterns, the \u201cFarmhouse\u201d pattern, showed a higher hazard ratio (HR), mostly driven by dairy products. In subsequent analyses, the increased risk of mortality for fresh cheese and decreased risk for fatty ham and eggs were confirmed. The a priori diet indexes (Italian Meddiet, Meddietscore, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Mediterranean\u2013DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet (MIND) indexes) showed borderline inverse relationships. In a Mediterranean population with an overall healthy diet, foods such as eggs and fatty meat, reflecting dietary energy and wealth, played a role in prolonging the life of individuals.

This review summarizes and describes the functions of phytohormones, such as abscisic acid, auxins, and ethylene, in modulating physiological and molecular responses to water scarcity. Drought-induced ABA-mediated stomatal closure and root extension are essential adaptation processes. Furthermore, auxin\u2013ABA (abscisic acid) interactions augment root flexibility, whereas ethylene regulates antioxidant defenses to alleviate oxidative stress. The advantageous function of endophytic bacteria, specifically plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), can augment drought resistance in spruce trees by enhancing nutrient absorption and stimulating root development. Structural adaptations encompass modifications in root architecture, including enhanced root length and density, which augment water uptake efficiency. Similarly, Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) significantly enhance stress resilience in forest trees. AMF establishes symbiotic relationships with plant roots, improving water and nutrient uptake, particularly phosphorus, during drought conditions. Furthermore, morphological alterations at the root\u2013soil interface enhance interaction with soil moisture reserves. This review examines the complex mechanisms by which these hormones influence plant responses to water shortage, aiming to offer insights into prospective techniques for improving drought tolerance in common tree species and highlights the importance of hormone control in influencing the adaptive responses of prominent trees to drought stress, providing significant implications for research and practical applications in sustainable forestry and agriculture. These findings lay the groundwork for improving drought tolerance in Populus spp. by biotechnological means and by illuminating the complex hormonal networks that confer drought resistance.",

Identifying new biomarkers to distinguish Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) from NAFLD would aid in the treatment of NASH.

Validation of fibrosis stage-related pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) was performed using Sprague-Dawley rats liver fibrosis models induced by CCl4 or PS. Immune cell infiltration assessment demonstrated that stromal score, immune score, and ESTIMATE score were higher in patients with NASH compared to those with NAFL. BAX, BAK1, PYCARD, and NLRP3 were identified as hub genes that exhibit a strong correlation with fibrosis stage. Additionally, the expression of these genes was increased in fibrotic liver tissues induced by CCl4 and PS. The pyroptosis-associated gene signature effectively predicts the degree of liver fibrosis in NASH patients.

    "content": "Malaria, the deadliest parasitic disease in the world, is sexually dimorphic, inflammatory, and oxidative. Males experience more severe symptoms and mortality than females do; therefore, the roles of 17\u03b2-estradiol and testosterone in this phenomenon have been studied. Both hormones affect oxidative stress, the primary mechanism of Plasmodium elimination. Estradiol has antioxidant activity, but the role of testosterone is controversial. Testosterone increases oxidative stress by reducing superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT) activities, which increase lipoperoxidation in the testis. However, the antioxidant properties of testosterone in prostate and nervous tissue have also been reported. The discrepancies are probably because when testosterone levels increase, the aromatase enzyme transforms testosterone into estrogens that possess antioxidant activity, which masks the results. Therefore, it is unknown whether testosterone is involved in the sexual dimorphism that occurs in oxidative stress in malaria. In this work, we administered testosterone and simultaneously inhibited aromatase with letrozole to evaluate the role of testosterone in the sexually dimorphic pattern of oxidative stress that occurs in the blood, spleen, and brain of male and female CBA/Ca mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (P. berghei ANKA). Testosterone triggers parasitemia in males, who also display more oxidative stress than females in the absence of infection, leading to sexually dimorphic patterns. Interestingly, increasing testosterone levels in infected mice reduced oxidative stress in males and increased oxidative stress in females, reversing or eliminating the dimorphic patterns observed. Oxidative stress varies in each tissue; the brain was the most protected, while the blood was the greatest damaged. Our findings highlight the role of testosterone as a regulator of oxidative stress in a tissue and sex-specific manner; therefore, understanding the role of testosterone in malaria may contribute to the development of sex-specific personalized antimalarial therapies.",

Chronic hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and ineffective insulin effect and secretion are hallmarks of T2DM, leading to many serious secondary complications. These include, in particular, cardiovascular disorders, diabetic neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, diabetic foot, osteoporosis, liver damage, susceptibility to infections and some cancers. Polyphenols such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes, tannins, and lignans constitute an extensive and heterogeneous group of phytochemicals in fresh fruits, vegetables and their products. Various in vitro studies, animal model studies and available clinical trials revealed that flavonoids (e.g., quercetin, kaempferol, rutin, epicatechin, genistein, daidzein, anthocyanins), phenolic acids (e.g., chlorogenic, caffeic, ellagic, gallic acids, curcumin), stilbenes (e.g., resveratrol), tannins (e.g., procyanidin B2, seaweed phlorotannins), lignans (e.g., pinoresinol) have the ability to lower hyperglycemia, enhance insulin sensitivity and improve insulin secretion, scavenge reactive oxygen species, reduce chronic inflammation, modulate gut microbiota, and alleviate secondary complications of T2DM. The interaction between polyphenols and conventional antidiabetic drugs offers a promising strategy in the management and treatment of T2DM, especially in advanced disease stages. Synergistic effects of polyphenols with antidiabetic drugs have been documented, but also antagonistic interactions that may impair drug efficacy. Therefore, additional research is required to clarify mutual interactions in order to use the knowledge in clinical applications. Nevertheless, dietary polyphenols can be successfully applied as part of supportive treatment for T2DM, as they reduce both obvious clinical symptoms and secondary complications.",

Participants completed standardized laparoscopic and robotic surgical tasks at varying levels of complexity while their cognitive workload was measured using fNIRS. This study included both simulation-based training and real-world surgical environments. Hemodynamic responses in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), task completion times, and performance metrics were analyzed. Results: Laparoscopic surgery elicited higher activity changes in the prefrontal cortex, indicating increased cognitive demand compared with robotic surgery, particularly for complex tasks like knot tying. Task complexity significantly influenced mental load, with more intricate procedures eliciting greater neural activation. Real-world training resulted in higher cognitive engagement than simulation, emphasizing the gap between simulated and actual surgical performance. Conclusions: Cognitive workload was lower and significantly different during robotic surgery than during laparoscopy, potentially due to its ergonomic advantages and enhanced motor control. Simulation-based training effectively prepares surgeons, but the cognitive workload results indicate that it may not fully replicate real-world surgical environments. These findings reveal the importance of cognitive workload assessment in surgical education and suggest that incorporating neuroimaging techniques such as fNIRS into training programs could enhance skill acquisition and performance.",

    "content": "The human gut flora of trillions of bacteria is vital for general health and greatly influences digestion, immune system function, and brain development. Through neuronal, hormonal, and immunological channels, the gut-brain axis (GBA), a bidirectional communication network, links the gut microbiota to the central nervous system (CNS). This relationship has been linked to affective diseases, including depression and anxiety, as well as mental health issues.This review explores the intricate relationship between gut bacteria and mood disorders, focusing on how gut microbiota-host interactions, immune system modulation, and neurotransmitter control support mental health. The function of important microbial metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), in preserving blood-brain barrier integrity and modulating neuroinflammation is covered in this review. It also examines the bidirectional impact between gut health and mental health, including how dysbiosis could aggravate mood disorders and how depressed states might change the composition of gut bacteria. Furthermore, we discuss how psychotropic drugs affect gut flora and consider other elements such as nutrition and lifestyle that affect gut microbiome composition. Potential paths for treating mood disorders through gut microbiota modification are presented as emerging treatment techniques, including probiotics, nutritional therapies, and precision medicine.The development of new therapeutic approaches for mood disorders depends on the awareness of the GBA. Gut bacteria significantly affect mental health through immune modulation, neurotransmitter generation, and other intricate processes. Future studies should concentrate on large, varied populations to better understand these interactions and to create customized treatments that combine gut microbiota modulation with conventional mental health therapies.",

Rats were fed high-fat diets for 12 weeks, and casein and chicken fillet were used as controls in all sub-experiments. While casein, chicken-, or pork fillet diets resulted in similar weight gain and plasma lipid levels, the CPH diet reduced plasma total cholesterol. This effect was dose dependent and accompanied with the reduced hepatic activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase. Further, rats fed combined CPH and CO showed lower weight gain, and higher hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, plasma L-carnitine, short-chain acylcarnitines, TMAO, and acetylcarnitine/palmitoylcarnitine.

    "content": "Background: Studies have shown that dietary source of protein and peptides can affect energy metabolism and influence obesity-associated diseases. This study aimed to investigate the impact of different chicken protein hydrolysates (CPHs) generated from chicken rest raw materials in a mouse obesity model. Methods: Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet with casein or CPHs generated using Papain + Bromelain, Alcalase, Corolase PP, or Protamex for 12 weeks (n = 12). Body weight, feed intake, and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance was determined, and plasma and liver and adipose tissues were collected at sacrifice. Results: The average feed intake and body weight did not differ between the groups and white adipose tissue depots were unchanged, except for a reduction in the subcutaneous depot in mice fed the Protamex CPH diet. Moreover, the CPH diets did not prevent increased fasting glucose and insulin levels. Interestingly, the hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation was increased in mice fed Alcalase and Corolase PP CPHs. All CPH diets reduced plasma interleukine (IL)-1\u03b2, interferon-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 compared to control, indicating anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, Corolase PP and Protamex CPHs significantly reduced plasma levels of IL-1\u03b1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Conclusions: CPH diets were not able to counteract obesity and glucose intolerance in a mouse obesity model, but strongly reduced inflammatory parameters associated with obesity.

The E-DII score was calculated based on energy-adjusted average intakes of 33 food or nutrient items derived from up to five 24-hour dietary recalls. Multivariable Cox regression models were used estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for incident CD and UC.ResultsDuring a median 12.3 years of follow-up, 382 incident CD and 798 incident UC cases were ascertained.

While polysaccharides have demonstrated anti-AD effects, the properties of Cremastra appendiculata polysaccharides (CAPs) remain underexplored. This study evaluates the physicochemical properties, antioxidant activity, anti-AD effects, and underlying mechanisms of CAP in vitro and in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) AD models. CAP, containing 22.37% uronic acid, is stable below 270 \u00b0C and adopts a triple helix structure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals an irregular layered architecture. In vitro, CAP exhibits significant antioxidant activity, protecting PC12 cells from A\u03b2-induced cytotoxicity. In C. elegans, CAP extends the lifespan in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting growth, alleviating tau-induced locomotor defects, reducing A\u03b2-induced paralysis and serotonin hypersensitivity, and decreasing A\u03b2 deposition by 79.96% at 2.0 mg/mL. CAP enhances antioxidant capacity and heat resistance by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and increasing glutathione S-transferase 4 (GST-4) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities. Additionally, CAP upregulates key genes in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway, including daf-16 and skn-1, along with their downstream targets (sod-3, ctl-1, gst-4, hsp-70). These findings suggest that CAP has potent antioxidant and anti-AD effects, alleviating A\u03b2- and tau-induced toxicity, and may serve as a promising therapeutic agent for Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

    "content": "Neuroinflammation is a complex immune response triggered by brain injury or pathological stimuli, and is highly exacerbated in neurodegenerative diseases. It plays a dual role in the central nervous system, promoting repair in acute stages while aggravating disease progression by contributing to neuronal loss, synaptic dysfunction, and glial dysregulation in chronic phases. Inflammatory responses are mainly orchestrated by microglia and infiltrated monocytes, which, when dysregulated, not only harm existing neurons, but also impair the survival and differentiation of neural stem and progenitor cells in the affected brain regions. Modulating neuroinflammation is crucial for harnessing its protective functions while minimizing its detrimental effects. Current therapeutic strategies focus on fine-tuning inflammatory responses through pharmacological agents, bioactive molecules, and stem cell-based therapies. These approaches aim to restore immune homeostasis, support neuroprotection, and promote regeneration in various neurological disorders. However, animal models sometimes fail to reproduce human-specific inflammatory responses in the brain. In this context, stem-cell-derived models provide a powerful tool to study neuroinflammatory mechanisms in a patient-specific and physiologically relevant context. These models facilitate high-throughput screening, personalized medicine, and the development of targeted therapies while addressing the limitations of traditional animal models, paving the way for more targeted and effective treatments.",

However, evidence for the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive frailty, a concept combining physical frailty and cognitive impairment in older adults, is lacking.ObjectiveThis study aimed to examine the associations of sleep duration and its changes with cognitive frailty.MethodsWe analyzed data from the 2008\u20102018 waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. Cognitive frailty was rendered based on the modified Fried frailty phenotype and Mini-Mental State Examination. Sleep duration was categorized as short (<6 h), moderate (6\u20109 h), and long (>9 h). We examined the association of sleep duration with cognitive frailty status at baseline using logistic regressions and with the future incidence of cognitive frailty using Cox proportional hazards models. Restricted cubic splines were used to explore potential nonlinear associations.ResultsAmong 11,303 participants, 1298 (11.5%) had cognitive frailty at baseline. Compared to participants who had moderate sleep duration, the odds of having cognitive frailty were higher in those with long sleep duration (odds ratio 1.71, 95% CI 1.48\u20101.97; P<.001). A J-shaped association between sleep duration and cognitive frailty was also observed (P<.001). Additionally, during a mean follow-up of 6.7 (SD 2.6) years among 5201 participants who were not cognitively frail at baseline, 521 (10%) participants developed cognitive frailty. A higher risk of cognitive frailty was observed in participants with long sleep duration (hazard ratio 1.32, 95% CI 1.07\u20101.62; P=.008).ConclusionsLong sleep duration was associated with cognitive frailly in older Chinese adults.

    "content": "AbstractThe question of why more people in Glasgow were dying, and younger, compared with English cities with almost identical levels of deprivation, was a hot topic in Scottish public health debates in the early 21st century. Public health researchers, particularly the Glasgow Centre of Population Health (GCPH), used the terms \u2018Glasgow effect\u2019 and \u2018Scottish effect\u2019 as placeholders while identifying the unknown factors behind Scotland\u2019s excess mortality. Yet the terms took on a colourful life of their own in the press and larger culture and continue to circulate, despite GCPH\u2019s attempts to retire them. This paper is the first to analyse the cultural life of the \u2018Glasgow effect\u2019 and \u2018Scottish effect\u2019 terms. Looking primarily at the Scottish press 1998\u20132022, I analyse the politically charged and often controversial debates and lay recommendations around the concepts. I also trace the terms\u2019 parallel usage, and indeed origin, in contexts unrelated to health. I argue that the \u2018Glasgow effect\u2019 functions as a myth. This myth emphasises Scottish exceptionalism in public health and larger culture, at a time when devolution and the prospect of independence heightened optimism and anxiety about Scotland\u2019s future. It overlaps with a larger and longstanding myth of Scottish cultural pathology, or the pathological Scot. The flexibility of the \u2018Glasgow effect\u2019 and \u2018Scottish effect\u2019 terms is exploited by journalists, academics and artists to serve competing agendas, establish their own expertise and influence public opinion. While it may now be challenging to eradicate these terms, especially in lay contexts, researchers and policy makers should avoid using these unstable terms uncritically. The example of the \u2018Glasgow effect\u2019 shows how health concepts can become wrapped in larger national or political narratives and highlights the difficulties for public health communicators in introducing complex and emerging public health ideas into a dynamic landscape of lay beliefs.",

This systematic review aimed to provide an overview of potential GC-associated pairs.Materials and MethodsWe systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases, from their inception to April 23, 2022, for eligible systematic reviews and meta-analyses to investigate the association between any possible factors and GC risk. After the inclusion of 75 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, 117 association pairs were examined. We reanalyzed the included meta-analyses and produced effect estimates using uniform analytical models. The certainty of the evidence for each association pair was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria.ResultsIatrogenic factors, including antibacterial drugs, were associated with an increased risk of GC. Epstein-Barr virus and Helicobacter pylori infections were also associated with an increased risk of GC, while human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infections were associated with a reduced risk. Dietary habit was a major factor influencing moderate to high GRADE associations. Positive associations were observed for heavy alcohol consumption (relative risk [RR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06\u20131.12), refined grain consumption (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.21\u20131.53), and habitual salt intake (RR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.04\u20131.91).ConclusionsThe associations between GC risk and dietary and nutritional factors were considerably heterogeneous, whereas other factors, such as lifestyle and iatrogenic and environmental exposures, were consistent across regions. Therefore, dietary interventions for GC prevention should be tailored specific to regions.Trial RegistrationPROSPERO Identifier: CRD42020209817",

This study evaluates SDEs\u2019 safety and skin-enhancing properties to improve their beauty-related and medical applications. Methods: The SDEs purified via ultracentrifugation were tested for their cytotoxic effects on HaCaT cell viability in scratch wound healing assays and for skin barrier gene modulation in HaCaT keratinocytes and Detroit 551 fibroblasts. A reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to analyze the changes in skin barrier gene expression following the SDE treatment. Cosmetic prototypes containing SDEs were assessed for skin irritation, cooling effects, periorbital wrinkle reduction, elasticity, and whitening properties. Results: The cytotoxicity and human topical tests confirmed the safety of SDE application. The SDEs accelerated wound closure, elevated the skin barrier gene expression level, and improved the clinical parameters, including wrinkle reduction, elasticity enhancement, and whitening. No irritation or side effects were observed.

    "content": "RationaleIn 2018, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) classified Gaming Disorder (GD) as a mental disorder. GD mainly occurs among adolescents, who, after developing addiction, show psychopathological traits, such as social anxiety, depression, social isolation, and attention deficit. However, the different studies conducted in humans so far show several limitations, such as the lack of demographic heterogeneity and equal representation of age, differences in the type of game and in the follow-up period. Furthermore, at present, no animal models specific to GD are available.ObjectivesTo address the lack of an experimental model for GD, in the present work, we proposed a new GD rat model to investigate some peculiar tracts of the disorder.MethodsTwo-month-old Wistar Kyoto rats, both males and females, were subject to a five-week training with a new innovative touch-screen platform. After five weeks of training, rats were assessed for: (a) their attachment to the play under several conditions, (b) their hyperactivity during gaming, and (c) the maintenance of these conditions after a period of game pause and reward interruption. After sacrifice, using immunohistochemistry techniques, the immunoreactivity of c-Fos (a marker of neuronal activity) was analyzed to study different neural areas.ResultsAfter the training, the rats subjected to GD protocol developed GD-related traits (e.g., hyperactivity, loss control), and the behavioral phenotype was maintained consistently over time. These aspects were completely absent in the control groups. Lastly, the analysis of c-Fos immunoreactivity in prelimbic cortex (PrL), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), nucleus Accumbens, amygdala and bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) highlighted significant alterations in the GD groups compared to controls, suggesting modifications in neural activity related to the development of the GD phenotype.ConclusionsThe proposal of a new GD rat model could represent an innovative tool to investigate, in both sexes, the behavioral and neurobiological features of this disorder, the possible role of external factors in the predisposition and susceptibility and the development of new pharmacological therapies.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00213-024-06576-y.",

Public interest and contributing to a broader societal solution were also mentioned. Knowledge about dementia\u00a0(prevention) was limited, and perceptions were largely shaped by personal experiences of dementia with close ones. In theme (2) 'Contextual factors influencing participation' are discussed, including work, living situation, and health conditions. According to participants, the main 'Lifestyle-related areas for improvement', theme (3), were diet and physical activity, followed to a lesser extent by cognition, sleep,\u00a0social activities, and stress management. Theme (4) 'Expectations regarding FINGER-NL' discussed barriers to change\u00a0which included physical health of participants, time constraints, established habits, and financial limitations. Participants emphasized the need for counselling, coaching in diet and exercise, experiencing positive effects of lifestyle change, participation in group setting and practical aspects, such as appointment reminders to support their commitment and adherence to the study. Participants held different experiences and opinions regarding 'Use of technology', theme (5). Personal experiences with dementia strongly influenced the motivation to participate in FINGER-NL, creating urgency for behaviour change. Participants expressed the wish to receive tailored interventions addressing individual needs and circumstances. Longitudinal follow-up within FINGER-NL promises valuable insights for future interventions.",

The study included individuals who resided at an altitude of more than 2100 meters, were aged 35 years or older. The data were randomly divided into a development set and a validation set at a ratio of 7:3. Single-factor and multifactor logistic regression equations were employed to identify pertinent variables and construct a scoring system. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were used to evaluate the discriminative ability of the questionnaire.ResultsA total of 2909 individuals were included in this study, including 1304 males (44.83%), with a median age of 47.00 (41.00\u201355.00) years. A multivariate analysis of the development set revealed that five variables (age, history of pulmonary tuberculosis, smoking status, household air pollution exposure and CPOD Assessment Test\u00a0(CAT) score) were significantly correlated with COPD. A scoring system was constructed on the basis of these findings. The AUC for the model in the development set was 0.714, whereas that for the validation set was 0.726. ROC analysis indicated that the optimal diagnostic cutoff value for the score was 22 points, with a sensitivity of 85.0% and a specificity of 48.4%. The results indicated that the sensitivity of the model was the highest (87.3%) at altitudes between 2100 and 3000 meters, whereas the specificity was the highest (80.9%) at altitudes >4000 meters. The conclusions were essentially consistent when the lower limit of normal (LLN) was used to verify the values in different altitude areas.ConclusionThe COPD screening questionnaire effectively screens COPD in high-altitude primary healthcare settings.",

    "content": "The Mediterranean diet (MD) is widely recognized for its health benefits, particularly in modulating gut microbiota composition and reducing the risk of metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases. Characterized by a high intake of plant-based foods, monounsaturated fats, and polyphenols, primarily from extra virgin olive oil, the MD fosters the growth of beneficial gut bacteria such as Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Roseburia, which produce short-chain fatty acids that enhance gut barrier integrity, reduce inflammation, and improve metabolic homeostasis. Clinical and preclinical studies have proved that the MD is associated with increased microbial diversity, reduced pro-inflammatory bacteria, and improved markers of insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism, and cognitive function. Additionally, the MD positively influences the gut microbiota in various conditions, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration, potentially mitigating systemic inflammation and enhancing neuroprotective mechanisms. Emerging evidence suggests that MD variants, such as the Green-MD, and their integration with probiotics can further optimize gut microbiota composition and metabolic parameters. While the beneficial impact of the MD on the gut microbiota and overall health is well supported, further long-term clinical trials are needed to better understand individual variability and improve dietary interventions tailored to different populations.",

This study aimed at investigating the nephroprotective potential of two doses 150 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg of Tanacetum balsamita leaf extract (ETB) on metabolic-induced renal injury (MIRI) in rats. Markers of renal oxidative stress and antioxidant defense, histopathology, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis were measured. Blood glucose level and arterial blood pressure were assessed weekly for the experimental period of eight weeks. ETB at a high dose significantly decreased the blood glucose levels and mildly lowered systolic pressure in diabetic rats. In the kidney, ETB restored the antioxidant marker malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, and markedly increased enzymatic activity related to GSH turnover by 46% (GPx), 22% (GR), 32% (GST), and 96% (SOD). ETB reduced elevated urea and creatinine levels and alleviated the proteinuria along with other urinalysis parameters. Histopathological examination of the kidney supported the observed protective effects. Both doses of the ETB ameliorated most of the investigated parameters similarly to positive controls enalapril and acarbose. ETB benefits on MIRI-induced damages could be associated with high levels of mono- and dicaffeoylquinic acids together with a series of methoxylated flavones and flavonols, which may hold significance for its antidiabetic and nephroprotective activity.",

Therefore, this study aims to provide a potentially novel therapeutic approach by examining olive oil's effects on bone mineral density (BMD), biochemical markers, biomechanical properties, and histopathological changes in an ovariectomized (OVX) rat model.MethodsIn this study, Twenty-four 6-month-old female Wistar rats were randomly allocated into four equal groups (n = 6 rats, for each group): control group, rats given 1mL/100g olive oil, ovariectomized rats (OVX-group), and OVX rats treated with olive oil. The femoral bone mineral density (BMD), biochemical parameters, biomechanical properties, and histopathological features were studied.ResultsAfter 3 months of extra virgin olive oil treatment, there were significant improvements in the different estimated parameters. This was demonstrated by preventing the changes in bone remodeling and BMD, improving the hormonal changes, oxidant/antioxidant imbalance, and abnormal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with OVX-induced osteoporosis. In addition, there was a marked improvement in the histological architecture of the cancellous and cortical bone appearance.ConclusionOlive oil dietary intake effectively reduces the impact of osteoporosis induced by ovariectomy in rats, suggesting a potentially feasible treatment option for postmenopausal osteoporosis that benefits bone architecture without any detrimental side effects on women's health.",

    "content": "AbstractIntroductionHypertension is prevalent in older women and men, but the impact of sex differences is unclear.MethodsBlood pressure (BP) was evaluated weekly for 15 weeks using tail-cuff plethysmography in intact or gonadectomized female and male rats. Similarly, gonadectomized rats were subcutaneously treated daily for 15 weeks with estradiol in females or testosterone in males. Treatment with estrogen in males and androgen in females for BP was also examined. The non-genomic antihypertensive potency and efficacy of different sex steroids were determined; catheters were implanted in the carotid artery of hypertensive rats for BP recording with bolus injections in the jugular vein at cumulative doses (1 \u00d7 10\u22127\u22121 \u00d7 10\u22124M kg\u22121 min\u22121) of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), estradiol, testosterone, or 5\u03b2-dihydrotestosterone (5\u03b2-DHT).ResultsData showed a time-dependent increase in BP after gonadectomy in female and male rats until hypertension values were reached. Males are more sensitive to the development of hypertension than females. The increases in BP in females and males were completely prevented by estradiol or testosterone, respectively. Testosterone completely prevented hypertension in females, whereas estradiol only partially in males. Antihypertensive potencies in conscious hypertensive rats were DHEA = 5\u03b2-DHT = testosterone >> estradiol, in females and DHEA = 5\u03b2-DHT >> testosterone >> estradiol in males. The efficacy was DHEA = 5\u03b2-DHT = testosterone >> estradiol in females and 5\u03b2-DHT = DHEA >> testosterone >> estradiol in males.ConclusionGonadectomized males developed hypertension faster than females, suggesting that androgen deficiency plays an important role in BP reduction. Antihypertensive responses of steroids are structure-dependent; estradiol demonstrated the lowest potency, whereas 5\u03b2-DHT was a potent antihypertensive without estrogenic and androgenic actions, suggesting it is as a therapeutic candidate for controlling hypertension in both sexes.",

Safety of oral pyrophosphate treatment was assessed with special focus on gastrointestinal tolerance, serum phosphate and calcium levels, and potential electrocardiography abnormalities. Absorption kinetics and peak plasma pyrophosphate concentrations were measured by the adenosine triphosphate sulfurylase method.ResultsGastrointestinal adverse effects associated with oral pyrophosphate treatment were rare and mild. The only consistent abnormality among the serum parameters studied was a transient elevation of serum phosphate levels (change: 0.2 to 0.62 and 0.15 to 0.44 mmol/L in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively). Based on electrocardiography results, both doses can be regarded as safe in terms of corrected QT interval prolongation in short\u2010term treatment. Serum pyrophosphate levels increased significantly in both cohorts.ConclusionOral pyrophosphate treatment was found to be safe in patients with systemic sclerosis and resulted in elevated plasma concentrations comparable to results obtained in healthy volunteers. This provides rationale to test the therapeutic potential of pyrophosphate against calcinosis.",

This study aimed to assess the nutritional status of older adults in rural communities in Taiwan and explore the association between characteristics and the dietary diversity score (DDS). Methods: We collected data on sociodemographic, nutritional status, and DDS. The DDS was estimated based on nutritional intake using a 24 h dietary recall (24HR). Participants were grouped by distance from the city center into three categories (0\u20134 km, 4\u20138 km, and >8 km) to assess their correlation with food diversity. Results: A total of 567 participants were included, of whom 81.3% were women, and 65.5% were over 75 years of age. Of the participants, 154 lived within 4 km of the city center, 255 lived 4\u20138 km away, and 158 resided in remote communities (>8 km from the city center). Out of 538 participants who completed the dietary questionnaire, 274 (50.9%) were categorized as having low dietary diversity (DDS \u2264 4), while 264 (49.1%) were categorized as having high dietary diversity (DDS > 4). Conclusions: Our results showed the distance from the community to the city center significantly influences the DDS of the residents in rural communities. Nearly half of the rural population has a low DDS. The implementation of the research project aimed to determine the feasibility of daily nutrition evaluation and optimization programs for the elderly in rural areas is crucial in the future.",

The aim of this study was to determine the dose-dependent effect of a CFO against bone loss in C57BL/6 female mice during aging. Twelve-month old mice were fed with 1% and 4% CFO and 4% safflower oil (SFO) diets, including a group with a 4% regular-FO diet and a group with a lab chow diet for 12 months. Bone mineral density (BMD) was analyzed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) before and after the dietary intervention. At the end of dietary intervention, bone resorption markers in serum and inflammatory markers in bone marrow and splenocytes and inflammatory signaling pathways in the bone marrow were analyzed. As compared to the 4% SFO control, 4% CFO maintained higher BMD during aging, while 1% CFO offered only a mild benefit. However, the 1% CFO fed group exhibited slightly better BMD than the 4% regular-FO fed group. BMD loss protection by CFO was accompanied by reduced levels of the bone resorption marker, TRAP, and the osteoclast-stimulating-factor, RANKL, without affecting the decoy-receptor of RANKL, osteoprotegerin (OPG). Further, CFO supplementation was associated with an increase in the production of IL-10, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b3 and a decrease in the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, and the activation of NF-\u03baB, p38 MAPK, and JNK signaling pathways. In conclusion, the supplementation of 4% CFO is very efficient in maintaining BMD during aging, whereas 1% CFO is only mildly beneficial. CFO supplementation starting at middle age may maintain better bone health during aging.",

Self-medication with antibiotics in low- and middle-income countries has been identified as a driver of antibiotic resistance. Interventions targeting solely individual behaviour change around antibiotic practices are often unsuccessful as they fail to address socio-cultural and structural causes of the problem. Understanding the context of antibiotic use in communities will better inform interventions addressing the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. Vietnam faces a growing threat of antimicrobial resistance due to inappropriate use of antibiotics in the healthcare system, farming and food production, and in the community. To understand the roots of this problem, we conducted qualitative research in 2020, with one component focusing on the community. This included fifteen in-depth interviews with women and four months of participant observation in three districts in Nam Dinh Province to explore the healthcare seeking practices and perceptions of medicine and antibiotic use. We argue that even when participants understood antibiotic resistance and were willing to adjust their care practices with antibiotics, there were cultural and structural challenges demotivating changes. The participants faced what we term \u201cdilemmas of care\u201d. For example, while public health messaging promoted appropriate antibiotic practices, the healthcare system did not provide a suitable environment to support appropriate use. Besides, the introduction of biomedicines into the long-standing traditional medical system caused confusions in community health practices, leading to issues such as poor adherence to treatment. At an individual level, participants faced challenges in accessing healthcare knowledge, adhering to social expectations surrounding care, and financial issues. We argue that the misuse of medicines and antibiotics in communities are responses to a deficient healthcare system and unequal access to quality healthcare.",

The resolution of inflammation has emerged as a critical endogenous process that protects host tissues from prolonged or excessive inflammation, which can become chronic. Failure of the inflammation resolution is a key pathological mechanism that drives the progression of numerous inflammatory diseases. Owing to the various side effects of currently available drugs to control inflammation, novel therapeutic agents that can prevent or suppress inflammation are needed. Supersulfides are highly reactive and biologically potent molecules that function as antioxidants, redox regulators, and modulators of cell signaling. The catenation state of individual sulfur atoms endows supersulfides with unique biological activities. Great strides have recently been made in achieving a molecular understanding of these sulfur species, which participate in various physiological and pathological pathways. This review mainly focuses on the anti-inflammatory effects of supersulfides. The review starts with an overview of supersulfide biology and highlights the roles of supersulfides in both immune and inflammatory responses. The various donors used to generate supersulfides are assessed as research tools and potential therapeutic agents. Deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular bases of supersulfide-driven biology can help guide the development of innovative therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat diseases associated with various immune and inflammatory responses.",

They often exert significant impacts on animal health and livestock production. Scientists have studied natural products for over half a century due to their diverse chemical composition, acknowledging their value in fighting cancer. Acorns (Quercus ilex) are believed to have several unexplored pharmacological properties. This study aimed to evaluate the in vivo safety and cancer chemopreventive activity of an infusion extract of Q. ilex in a transgenic mouse model of human PV (HPV)-16, which developed squamous cell carcinomas through a multistep process driven by HPV16 oncogenes.Materials and Methods:Q. ilex extract was prepared by heating in water at 90\u00b0C and then characterized by mass spectrometry. Phenolic compounds from this extract were administered in drinking water to female mice in three different concentrations (0.03, 0.06, and 0.09 g/mL) over a period of 28 consecutive days. Six groups (n = 6) were formed for this study: group 1 (G1, wildtype [WT], water), group 2 (G2, HPV, water), group 3 (G3, WT, 0.09 g/mL), group 4 (G4, HPV, 0.03 g/mL), group 5 (G5, HPV, 0.06 g/mL), and group 6 (G6, HPV, 0.09 g/mL). Throughout the experiment, humane endpoints, body weight, food intake, and water consumption were recorded weekly. Following the experimental period, all mice were sacrificed, and blood, internal organs, and skin samples were collected. Blood was used to measure glucose and microhematocrit and later biochemical parameters, such as creatinine, urea, albumin, alanine aminotransferase, and total proteins. Histological analysis was performed on skin and organ samples.Results:The administration of Q. ilex extract resulted in a statistically significant increase in relative organ weight among HPV transgenic animals, indicating adaptive biological response to the tested concentrations. Moreover, a reduction in characteristic skin lesions was observed in animals treated with the 0.06 and 0.09 g/mL extract.Conclusion:These results provide a favorable chemopreventive profile for Q. ilex extract at concentrations of 0.06 and 0.09 g/mL. This study highlights the potential of Q. ilex extract as a safe and effective therapeutic strategy against HPV16-associated lesions in transgenic mouse models. The limitation of our study was the durability of transgenic animals. As a more sensitive species, we must always be careful with the durability of the test. We intend to study concentrations of 0.06 and 0.09 g/mL for longer to further investigate their possible effects.",

    "content": "AbstractContextThe global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased significantly in recent decades. Despite numerous studies and systematic reviews, there is a gap in comprehensive and up-to-date evaluations in this rapidly evolving field.ObjectiveThis review provides a comprehensive and current overview of the efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in treating T2DM.MethodsA systematic review was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, Wanfang Data, CNKI, and Medline databases, with a search timeframe extending up to November 2023. The search strategy involved a combination of subject terms and free words in English, including \u2018Diabetes,\u2019 \u2018Traditional Chinese Medicine,\u2019 \u2018TCM,\u2019 \u2018Hypoglycemic Effect,\u2019 \u2018Clinical Trial,\u2019 and \u2018Randomized Controlled Trial.\u2019 The studies were rigorously screened by two investigators, with a third investigator reviewing and approving the final selection based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.ResultsA total of 108 relevant papers were systematically reviewed. The findings suggest that TCMs not only demonstrate clinical efficacy comparable to existing Western medications in managing hypoglycemia but also offer fewer adverse effects and a multitarget therapeutic approach. Five main biological mechanisms through which TCM treats diabetes were identified: improving glucose transport and utilization, improving glycogen metabolism, promoting GLP-1 release, protecting pancreatic islets from damage, and improving intestinal flora.ConclusionsTCM has demonstrated significant protective effects against diabetes and presents a viable option for the prevention and treatment of T2DM. These findings support the further exploration and integration of TCM into broader diabetes management strategies.",

    "content": "This study employs the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to forecast under-five mortality rates in Ghana, Niger, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone for the years 2030 and 2031. Using World Bank Indicators data from 1967 to 2021, the study evaluates these countries\u2019 progress toward achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3), which aims to reduce under-five mortality to less than 25 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2030. The objective is to provide data-driven insights into future mortality trends, supporting policymakers and healthcare professionals in designing targeted interventions to accelerate progress. The results reveal distinct mortality patterns among the four countries. Ghana, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone exhibit a consistent decline in under-five mortality, while Niger shows a non-continuous decreasing trend, indicating potential stagnation or reversal. Projections for 2030 estimate mortality rates of 30.5 per 1,000 live births in Ghana, 109.5 in Niger, 84.5 in Nigeria, and 64.3 in Sierra Leone. By 2031, these rates are expected to reach 28.9 per 1,000 live births in Ghana, 110.4 in Niger, 81.7 in Nigeria, and 59.8 in Sierra Leone. The findings indicate that Ghana is on track to meet SDG 3, provided that sustained and enhanced healthcare interventions are implemented. However, Nigeria, Niger, and Sierra Leone remain off-target, requiring significant reductions in mortality rates to meet the SDG 3 benchmark. These projections offer valuable evidence for policymakers, emphasizing the need for urgent and data-driven strategies to combat under-five mortality in these nations.",

As T-cell and myeloid cell dysfunction have been associated with low magnesium conditions, we investigated whether serum magnesium (Mg) levels could predict clinical outcomes in LBCL patients who received chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy.MethodsPatients with LBCL who received axi-cel under the ZUMA-1 trial or as FDA approved therapy at Mayo Clinic were examined. Serum samples were obtained at specified time points and cytokine analysis was performed. Single cell RNA sequencing was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The Student T-test, Kruskal Wallis, or Fisher's Exact Tests were used to compare differences in demographics across Mg levels. Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan\u2013Meier methodology and compared using the Wilcoxon test.ResultsWe found that hypomagnesemia before lymphodepletion chemotherapy predicted inferior progression-free and overall survival in the pivotal study ZUMA-1 (NCT02348216). These results were validated in an independent cohort of LBCL patients receiving axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) at Mayo Clinic. Hypomagnesemia correlated with increased inflammatory serum markers and cytokine levels including ferritin, IL-6, IL1Ra, IL-8, and MIP1a. scRNAseq analysis unveiled altered immune interactions between monocytes and T cells with a concordant immune suppressive transcriptome.ConclusionsHypomagnesemia at the time of CAR-T infusion is associated with an unfavorable inflammatory profile and decreased response and survival in LBCL patients receiving axi-cel.

Approximately 2300 of the 8200 species are popularly characterized as medicinal or aromatic. Here, we compile information about the endemic medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) of Iran and map their distributions. Our survey found 180 endemic species of MAPs, belonging to 10 families and 30 genera. The majority of species are found in Lamiaceae, Fabaceae, and Apiaceae, with 86, 30, and 18 species, respectively. Approximately 70% of these plants have been recorded in the 10 provinces of Esfahan, Kerman, Fars, Tehran, Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari, East Azarbaijan, Lorestan, West Azarbaijan, Hamadan, and Mazandaran. These provinces are located in the Iran-o-Turanian region, one of the three major phytogeographic regions in Iran, which covers five areas of endemism (i.e., Azarbaijan, Zagros, Kopet Dagh-Khorassan, Alborz, and Central Alborz). So, Iran-o-Turanian region is the main center of diversity for the Iranian endemic MAPs. The north, center and western parts of Iran are rich in MAPs and could be considered as the dominant biodiversity hotspots of Iran more seemingly due to the diverse climatic and geographic assortment which generates the highest frequency and distribution of MAPs. Many of these MAPs are at the edge of extinction due to the unwise, unscientific harvesting and/or global climate change. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conserve and propagate some of these important MAPs to save them from extinction and also to ensure the availability of raw materials for their use and future research into their efficacy. Furthermore, identifying the areas of endemism (AEs) is an essential part of ongoing regional conservation management programs in Iran and worldwide.",

    "content": "Due to the increase in the aged population and increased life expectancy, the underlying mechanisms involved in the aging process and cell senescence and the ways for modulating these processes in age-related diseases become important. One of the main mechanisms involved in aging and cell senescence, especially in the diseases related to aging, is the oxidative stress process and the following inflammation. Hence, the effects of antioxidants are highlighted in the literature due to their beneficial impacts on inhibiting telomere shortening or DNA damage and other processes related to aging and cell senescence in age-related diseases. Dietary components, foods, and dietary patterns rich in antioxidants can modulate the aging process and delay the progression of some chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. Foods high in polyphenols, vitamin C, or carotenoids, olive oil, seeds, nuts, legumes, dietary supplements such as CoQ10, and some other dietary factors are the most important nutritional sources that have high antioxidant contents which can positively affect cell senescence and disease progression. Plant dietary patterns including Mediterranean diets can also inhibit telomere shortening following oxidative damages, and this can delay cell aging and senescence in age-related diseases. Further, olive oil can inhibit protein aggregation in Alzheimer's disease. It can be concluded that nutrition can delay the process of cell senescence in age-related diseases via inhibiting oxidative and inflammatory pathways. However, more studies are needed to better clarify the underlying mechanisms of nutrition and dietary components on cell senescence, aging, and disease progression, especially those related to age.",

Since IFX dosing is weight-based and associated with various side effects, there is a growing interest in identifying combination therapies that can enhance its efficacy, particularly in overweight inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, to maximize the anti-inflammatory effect while minimizing the required dose. Our research revealed that overweight IBD patients present decreased vitamin D levels in the intestinal epithelium alongside elevated TNF-\u03b1 levels. In mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for four weeks, treatment with the vitamin D analog palicalcitol (PAL) reduced lipid synthesis and TNF-\u03b1 production in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). In a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced experimental colitis model, PAL treatment mitigated TNF-\u03b1-induced damage to the intestinal epithelial barrier and reduced the activation of Th1 and Th17 cells in the lamina propria, thereby reducing colitis development in HFD-fed mice. Notably, the combination of IFX and PAL was more effective than IFX alone in treating colitis in these mice. Overall, our findings suggest that vitamin D inhibits TNF-\u03b1 production by reducing lipid synthesis in IECs, thereby enhancing IFX therapy in overweight IBD patients.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00018-025-05626-8.",

This severe pain frequently causes a significant disturbance in their quality of life. At present, there are different challenges in utilizing a range of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments for managing pain in cancer patients. Recent technological advancements, particularly in artificial intelligence, have improved the management of pain in cancer patients. Artificial intelligence and its algorithms offer potential solutions for pain relief in cancer patients with reduced side effects.\nStudy Design: The current review aimed to assess the validity of studies on using artificial intelligence in pain management for cancer patients. Four databases have been used to review all published studies from the start of 2023: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The search mechanism for articles was mainly using valid and mesh-based keywords, asking experts, and reviewing the literature and including \u201cPain,\u201d \u201cPain management,\u201d \u201cCancer,\u201d and \u201cArtificial intelligence.\u201d During the initial search, a total of 450 articles were found, and after considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria and reviewing the abstract and content of the articles, 15 articles were finally included in the study.\nResults: AI-based solutions can provide individual pain relief plans. When AI analyzes large patient data such as physiological signals, responses to treatment, and symptoms of patients who have been diagnosed with pain, it is possible to accurately adjust therapeutic measures.\nConclusions: AI enables healthcare providers to offer timely care and assistance to cancer patients through remote monitoring and telehealth services, even when they are not physically present.

Results: Although no significant changes were found in anthropometric parameters or blood pressure in either group, both interventions reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Surprisingly, total cholesterol (TC) levels rose in the bilberry juice group (from 6.41 \u00b1 1.23 mmol/L to 6.94 \u00b1 1.30 mmol/L (p < 0.001)), and in the fibre group (from 6.06 \u00b1 1.39 mmol/L to 6.43 \u00b1 1.05 mmol/L (p = 0.046)), likely due to elevated HDL-C (p < 0.001) overshadowing the drop in LDL-C (p < 0.05). Triglyceride (TG) levels did not change significantly and were still within the reference range.

Results suggested that T13 and T2 had partially similar drought stress response mechanisms. But the mainly drought response mechanisms in T13 (accumulated flavonoids and phenolic acids) was different from T2 (accumulated alkaloids).

In this work, using genotyping by sequencing (GBS)-derived SNP and silicoDArT markers, we present new insights into the genetic structure and level of genetic diversity in an international sugar beet germplasm (94 accessions from 16 countries). We also performed GWAS to identify candidate genes for agriculturally-relevant traits.ResultsAfter applying various filtering criteria, a total of 4,609 high-quality non-redundant SNPs and 6,950 silicoDArT markers were used for genetic analyses. Calculation of various diversity indices using the SNP (e.g., mean gene diversity: 0.31, MAF: 0.22) and silicoDArT (mean gene diversity: 0.21, MAF: 0.12) data sets revealed the existence of a good level of conserved genetic diversity. Cluster analysis by UPGMA revealed three and two distinct clusters for SNP and DArT data, respectively, with accessions being grouped in general agreement with their geographical origins and their tap root color. Coincidently, structure analysis indicated three (K\u2009=\u20093) and two (K\u2009=\u20092) subpopulations for SNP and DArT data, respectively, with accessions in each subpopulation sharing similar geographic origins and root color; and comparable clustering patterns were also found by principal component analysis. GWAS on 13 root and leaf phenotypic traits allowed the identification of 35 significant marker-trait associations for nine traits and, based on predicted functions of the genes in the genomic regions surrounding the significant markers, 25 candidate genes were identified for four root (fresh weight, width, length, and color) and three leaf traits (shape, blade color, and veins color).ConclusionsThe present work unveiled conserved genetic diversity\u2013evidenced both genetically (by SNP and silicoDArT markers) and phenotypically- exploitable in breeding programs and germplasm curation of sugar beet.

In Europe, the Iberian Peninsula and other Mediterranean countries are the ones with favorable climatic conditions for its cultivation. This document describes much of the history of pitaya in the Iberian Peninsula and the difficulties related to its cultivation. A bibliographical survey was carried out on the culture of pitaya in the world, focusing on the edaphoclimatic requirements, and on the possibility of this becoming a consolidated crop in the Iberian Peninsula. The relatively low water requirement of pitaya makes this crop sustainable among crops that require irrigation. In addition, we provide a perspective for use and research of this emerging crop. There has been an exponential growth of scientific publications on pitaya in the last decade; however, much more needs to be researched to know how to increase productivity as well as the sensory quality of fruits in different regions. This sustainable crop is a good option to diversify fruit production in the Iberian Peninsula.",

    "content": "Obesity and depression are likely to co-occur. However, there are few reports on the relationship between obesity and depression. We aimed to investigate the effect of high-fat diet combined with chronic restraint stress on depressive-like behaviors, focusing on the phenotypic transformation of astrocytes. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four equal groups: control, high-fat diet (HFD), chronic restraint stress (CRS) and HFD\u2009+\u2009CRS groups. They were subjected to an 8-week high-fat diet and 3-week restraint stress stimulation. In vitro, palmitic acid (PA) and corticosterone (Cort) were used to mimic HFD and CRS respectively on C8-D1A astrocytes. Our results showed that HFD aggravates anxiety and depression-like behaviors and learning and memory deficits induced by CRS, as reflected by sucrose preference, forced swimming test, tail suspension tests, open field test and the Morris water maze. The expression level of C3 protein in the hippocampus of the mice in the HFD\u2009+\u2009CRS group was three times that of the CON group. HFD combined with CRS significantly inhibited the protein expression of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Consistent with the results of animal experiments, the results of the in vitro experiments showed that the protein expressions of A1 astrocytes marker in C8-D1A astrocytes were much higher in the PA\u2009+\u2009Cort group. And the protein expressions the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway-associated proteins were obviously lower in the PA\u2009+\u2009Cort group. Furthermore, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway agonist SKL2001 treatment decreased the A1 astrocytes marker expressions in C8-D1A astrocytes, and improves the anxiety and depression-like behaviors and learning and memory deficits in HFD mice combined with CRS. This study suggested that HFD combined with CRS could promote the transformation of astrocytes into A1 type and the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway may be involved in this process.",

Several industries have contributed to the increase in lead contamination, making it a major global concern. Thus, remediation strategies are necessary to prevent lead bioaccumulation and deleterious health effects. The aim of this study was to determine the capacity of the green microalga Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris or CV) to remove lead in an animal model and prevent the accumulation of this heavy metal in the principal organs (brain, liver, and kidney) and blood. Forty male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 10): control group (CT); C. vulgaris supplementation group, 5% of the diet (CV); lead acetate administration group, 500 ppm (Pb); and C. vulgaris supplementation group, 5% of the diet plus lead acetate administration group, 500 ppm (CV\u2013Pb). After 4 weeks of exposure, we measured lead accumulation, memory function, oxidative stress, and antioxidant activity (SOD and GSH). Lead exposure altered memory function, increased oxidative stress in the brain and kidney, and increased SOD activity in the brain. Supplementation with C. vulgaris restored memory function to control levels; reduced oxidative stress in the brain and kidney; and decreased the accumulation of lead in the liver, kidney, and blood of rats exposed to lead. Based on our results, C. vulgaris is a lead chelating and antioxidant agent in animal models.",

Employing a cross-sectional design, the study collected data from 10,369 individuals aged 65 and above across 35 communities/villages in China. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), cognitive function was evaluated with the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease-8 (AD-8) scale, and chronic disease conditions were recorded. The results indicated that older adults with multimorbidity (OR\u2009=\u20092.481, 95% CI: 2.117, 2.908) and those at high risk of cognitive impairment (OR\u2009=\u20095.469, 95% CI: 4.644, 6.441) exhibited a higher likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms. Further interaction analysis revealed that, after controlling for confounding factors, no significant multiplicative interaction was found between multimorbidity and cognitive impairment (P\u2009=\u20090.581); however, a significant additive interaction effect was observed (OR\u2009=\u200913.809, 95% CI: 11.063, 17.237). These findings suggest that multimorbidity and cognitive impairment are important factors associated with depressive symptoms in older adults, and their combined presence is linked to a substantially increased likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms compared to either condition alone.",

Enrichment analysis of the retained proteins identified glycolysis/gluconeogenesis as the most enriched pathway, with several proteins identified playing roles in carbon metabolism, amino acid synthesis. The data suggested that Bri2 BRICHOS may have a role in cellular energy demands in the brain via glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and may play a role in mitochondrial homeostasis.",

Then, C3/TPP-EXO was further used to encapsulate the curcumin (CUR) to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of the drug. By intravenously injected (i.v) into taup301s mutant transgenic (Tg) mice, C3/TPP-EXO facilitated the CUR to target the mitochondria of neurons and increase the entry efficiency of medication. To further reveal the mechanisms of drug entry, sodium azide (NaN3), an energy inhibitor, was used to treat HT22\u00a0cells. The results demonstrated that the entrance efficiency of the engineered EXO is significantly affected suggesting that C3/TPP-EXO may target mitochondria through energy routes. To deeply study the exact molecular mechanisms of C3/TPP-EXO-CUR in treating AD, RNA-Seq was used to identify the relevant molecules. Through GO annotation, many genes are enriched in the pathways of mitochondria functions. Based on these RNA-Seq data, C3/TPP-EXO-CUR showed neuroprotective effects via modulating the protein expression of Bcl-2, Bax and caspase-3 in HT22\u00a0cells. To further confirm the in vitro results, the in vivo results revealed that C3/TPP-EXO-CUR treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of tau and protected neurons by inhibiting the apoptotic genes, leading to improve the memory decline of taup301s mice.

However, the development and application of current AI technologies to meet patients\u2019 needs and improve their performance in chronic condition self-management tasks remain poorly understood. It is crucial to gather comprehensive information to guide the development and selection of effective AI solutions tailored for self-management in patients with chronic conditions.ObjectiveThis scoping review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of AI applications for chronic condition self-management based on 3 essential self-management tasks, medical, behavioral, and emotional self-management, and to identify the current developmental stages and knowledge gaps of AI applications for chronic condition self-management.MethodsA literature review was conducted for studies published in English between January 2011 and October 2024. In total, 4 databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO, were searched using combined terms related to self-management and AI. The inclusion criteria included studies focused on the adult population with any type of chronic condition and AI technologies supporting self-management. This review was conducted following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines.ResultsOf the 1873 articles retrieved from the search, 66 (3.5%) were eligible and included in this review. The most studied chronic condition was diabetes (20/66, 30%). Regarding self-management tasks, most studies aimed to support medical (45/66, 68%) or behavioral self-management (27/66, 41%), and fewer studies focused on emotional self-management (14/66, 21%). Conversational AI (21/66, 32%) and multiple machine learning algorithms (16/66, 24%) were the most used AI technologies. However, most AI technologies remained in the algorithm development (25/66, 38%) or early feasibility testing stages (25/66, 38%).ConclusionsA variety of AI technologies have been developed and applied in chronic condition self-management, primarily for medication, symptoms, and lifestyle self-management. Fewer AI technologies were developed for emotional self-management tasks, and most AIs remained in the early developmental stages. More research is needed to generate evidence for integrating AI into chronic condition self-management to obtain optimal health outcomes.",

However, the relationships between LC9 and eGDR and congestive heart failure (CHF) remain unknown.MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, participants aged \u226520 years in the NHANES database from 2005 to 2018 were analyzed. Weighted linear regression, logistic regression, subgroup analysis, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis were employed to analyze the associations among LC9, eGDR, and CHF. Mediation analysis was used to explore the mediating role of eGDR in the association between LC9 and CHF.ResultsA total of 22,699 adult participants were included, among whom 661 suffered from CHF. The mean age of the participants was 47.52 (0.26) years old, with 11186 (48.68%) males and 11513 (51.32%) females. The average value of LC9 was 71.16 (0.22), and that of eGDR was 7.91 (0.04). After adjusting for confounding factors, linear regression showed that LC9 was independently and positively associated with eGDR (\u03b2: 1.11, 95%CI: 1.07 - 1.14, P < 0.0001). Logistic regression indicated that both LC9 (OR: 0.76, 95%CI: 0.65 - 0.88, P < 0.001) and eGDR (OR: 0.81, 95%CI: 0.76 - 0.86, P < 0.0001) were independently and negatively associated with the prevalence of CHF. Mediation analysis revealed that the association between LC9 and CHF was mainly mediated by eGDR, with a proportion of 66%.ConclusionThis study suggests that higher LC9 scores and eGDR values imply a lower prevalence of CHF. Meanwhile, eGDR is the main intermediate factor in the association between LC9 and CHF, indicating that good CVH may reduce the prevalence of CHF by improving IR.",

    "content": "AbstractThis article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including prevalence and incidence, mortality and morbidity, use and costs of care, and the ramifications of AD for family caregivers, the dementia workforce, and society. The Special Report discusses Americans\u2019 attitudes about early diagnosis and treatment of AD. An estimated 7.2 million Americans age 65 and older live with Alzheimer's dementia today. This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060, barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or cure AD. Official AD death certificates recorded 120,122 deaths from AD in 2022. Since 2020, when COVID\u201019 became one of the top 10 causes of death in the United States, AD has ranked as the seventh\u2010leading cause of death. However, 2023 data indicate that Alzheimer's will probably become the sixth\u2010leading cause of death in the near future. Between 2000 and 2022, deaths from stroke, heart disease, and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths from AD increased by more than 142%. Nearly 12 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 19.2 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2024. These figures reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a decade earlier and an increase in the amount of care provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving was valued at $413.5 billion in 2024. Its costs, however, extend to unpaid caregivers\u2019 increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes. Members of the paid health care and broader community\u2010based workforce are involved in diagnosing, treating, and caring for people with dementia. However, the United States faces growing shortages across many segments of the dementia care workforce due to a combination of factors, including the absolute increase in the number of people living with dementia. Therefore, targeted programs and care delivery models are urgently needed to attract, better train, and effectively deploy health care and community\u2010based workers to provide dementia care. Average per\u2010person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are almost three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 22 times as great. Total payments in 2025 for health care, long\u2010term care, and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be $384 billion. The Special Report examines how Americans feel about new developments in diagnosing and treating AD. Based on survey results, most Americans believe early detection of Alzheimer's is important, and nearly all would want a simple diagnostic test if it were available to allow for early diagnosis and treatment. About two\u2010thirds of Americans are aware that new medications exist to slow the progression of AD, and most feel optimistic about the future of new Alzheimer's treatments over the next decade.",

The Japanese herbal medicine Ninjinyoeito (NYT), which is composed of 12 crude herbal components, has been used as a therapeutic in Japan to improve anorexia and fatigue, which are commonly observed in cancer patients with cachexia. We have previously reported that Citrus unshiu peel (CUP) contained in NYT can enhance food intake by activating the orexin 1 receptor (OX1R). Using the CellKey\u2122 system, which offers detection of OXR activity in intracellular impedance changes, NYT and CUP were found to activate OX1R, which in turn was inhibited by SB-674042, a selective OX1R antagonist. Among the flavonoids contained in CUP, nobiletin and hesperidin, but not naringin, activated OX1R. Furthermore, some monoterpenes contained in CUP, including limonene and linalool, but not terpineol, activated OX1R. In addition, nobiletin and limonene synergistically activated OX1R when added simultaneously. However, neither NYT nor CUP induced OX2R activity. The results collectively suggested that the CUP contained in NYT activates OX1R, but not OX2R, and that flavonoids and monoterpenes in CUP can synergistically activate OX1R. These findings could provide evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of NYT in cancer patients with cachexia.",

Therefore, feed nutritionists are looking for inexpensive and supply-stable alternatives to FM in fish feeds. This study aimed to assess the impacts of substituting FM with corn protein concentrate (CPC) in the diet of rockfish (Sebastes schlegeli) on the growth, feed availability, biochemical composition, and blood chemistry. Five hundred forty juvenile rockfish were uniformly dispersed into 18 tanks. Six isonitrogenous and isolipidic diets were prepared. The control (Con) diet contained 55% FM. The CPC10, CPC20, CPC30, CPC40, and CPC50 diets were prepared to substitute 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% FM with CPC in the Con diet, respectively. Triplicate groups of rockfish received the experimental diets twice daily for 56 days. The weight gain (WG) of rockfish fed the Con and CPC10 diets was significantly (P < 0.001) greater than that of rockfish fed all other diets. Rockfish fed the Con and CPC10 diets exhibited a comparable specific growth rate (SGR) to that of fish fed the CPC20 diet. Feed consumption (FC) of rockfish fed the Con diet was significantly (P < 0.0001) higher than that of rockfish fed all other diets, with the exception of the CPC10 diet. Rockfish fed the Con, CPC10, and CPC20 diets exhibited significantly (P < 0.0001) higher feed efficiency (FE) compared to rockfish fed all other diets. Protein efficiency ratio of rockfish fed the Con diet was significantly (P < 0.001) higher than that of fish fed the CPC40 and CPC50 diets. Rockfish fed the Con diet exhibited significantly (P < 0.01) greater protein retention than rockfish fed the CPC50 diet. However, the biological indices except for hepatosomatic index, biochemical composition, and blood chemistry of rockfish were not significantly (P > 0.05) influenced by FM substitution with CPC in diets. Conclusively, up to 10% and 20% of FM can be substituted with CPC in the rockfish diet without significantly lowering WG and FC, and SGR and FE, respectively.",

The questionnaire included the Kihon Checklist, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scale, Activity Scale for the Elderly, Fall Risk Index\u201021 and Dietary Variety Score. The associations among the scores of the scales and the 3\u2010year weight change from study entry were assessed. The participants were categorized into the non\u2010weight loss group, <4.5\u2010kg weight loss group and >4.5\u2010kg weight loss group.ResultsIn total, 982 participants completed the follow up.

Among the IADL questionnaire subitems, depositing and withdrawing money from the bank, walking, interacting with people, taking medication, and cooking were associated with 3\u2010year weight loss. Furthermore, cooking was strongly associated with weight loss. However, there was no association between eating frequency and weight loss. Finally, low IADL and physical function scores were associated with a doubled risk of future weight loss.ConclusionsAn association was found between 3\u2010year weight loss and physical fitness and IADL, such as walking, among community\u2010dwelling older people. Future weight loss in older people can be caused by a decline in IADL and physical fitness before a decline in dietary intake.

The aim of this study was to assess dietary and lifestyle factors associated with adequate sleep duration in children and adolescents living in five Mediterranean countries. Methods: Parents of children and adolescents taking part in an initial survey for the DELICIOUS project were examined to assess their children\u2019s dietary and eating habits (i.e., meal routines), as well as other lifestyle behaviors (i.e., physical activity levels, screen time, etc.) potentially associated with adequate sleep duration (defined as 8\u201310 h according to the National Sleep Foundation). The youth healthy eating index (Y-HEI) was used to assess the diet quality of children and adolescents. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), indicating the level of association between variables. Results: A total of 2011 individuals participated in the survey. The adolescents and children of younger parents reported being more likely to have inadequate sleep duration. Among eating behaviors, having breakfast (OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.62, 3.08) and eating at school (OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.74) were associated with adequate sleep duration. In contrast, children eating alone, screen time, and eating outside of the home were less likely to have adequate sleep duration, although these findings were only significant in the unadjusted model. After adjusting for covariates, a better diet quality (OR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.24, 2.16), including higher intake of fruits, meat, fish, and whole grains, was associated with adequate sleep duration. Conclusions: Adequate sleep duration seems to be highly influenced by factors related to individual lifestyles, family and school eating behaviors, as well as diet quality.",

    "content": "Metabolic syndromes (MetS) are complex metabolic disorders, the pathogenesis of which has not been fully elucidated. In recent years, the association between the gut microbiota and MetS has attracted widespread attention, but the causal relationship remains unclear. We performed a 2-sample Mendelian randomization analysis (MR) to examine whether the gut microbiota is causally related to MetS and its components to find a basis for potential diagnostic or intervention approaches for MetS. We utilized summary statistics from whole-genome association analyses of gut microbiota from the MiBioGen consortium and obtained MetS-related data from the UK Biobank, IEU Open GWAS project, and The Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC). MR analyses were performed using inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger, and weighted median. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to verify the robustness of the results. Among the 211 gut microbiota, we identified 8 that were significantly associated with the risk of MetS. Specifically, Lachnospiraceae (family), Veillonellaceae (family), Victivallaceae (family), Odoribacter (genus), and Olsenella (genus) may increase the risk of MetS, while Bifidobacteriaceae (family), Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 (genus), Actinobacteria (phylum) may decrease the risk of MetS. Additionally, we discovered that multiple microbiota are associated with various components of MetS, such as BMI, hypertension, and blood lipid levels. This study is the first to use MR methods to reveal the potential causal relationship between specific gut microbiota and MetS, providing a new perspective for understanding the pathogenesis of MetS, and offering important evidence for the development of gut microbiota-based prevention and treatment strategies for MetS.",

Methods: Four homogeneous groups of twenty-five patients each with hypertension degree 1 benefited from different 8-week recovery programs: recommendation for a healthy lifestyle (all groups\u2014A, B, C and D), antihypertensive medication (groups B, C and D), physical therapy program (group C), and hydrotherapy program (group D). Four parameters were pursued: body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (Wcir.), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP-DBP). Results: Intragroup comparison between initial and final testing registered a statistically significant decrease in all parameters for group C: BMI (p = 0.001), Wcir, SBP and DBP (p < 0.0001). Additionally, parameters of group D decreased significantly: BMI (p = 0.0005), Wcir, SBP and DBP (each p < 0.0001). Group A registered a statistical increase in the DPB parameter (p = 0.03), and group B had a significant decrease in SBP (p = 0.03).

Soybeans and derivatives (for example, flour, concentrate, or isolate) are the primary protein source for plant-based products, including meat analogs, and are naturally rich in iron. To investigate the nutritional contribution of iron naturally present in soy, this narrative review presents iron bioavailability data from isotope studies in humans aged >3 y. To allow interstudy comparison, we adjusted mean iron absorption for iron status (that is, serum ferritin of 15 \u03bcg/L), quantified native iron absorbed, and compared with daily human requirements for absorbed iron where possible. Adjusted iron absorption from soybeans served as part of meals varied widely (4.1%\u201322.2%), translating to contributions of 13%\u201370% and 10%\u201340% to the daily requirements for absorbed iron in adult males and females, respectively. Similar results were found for meals prepared with soy flour (full fat, defatted, and texturized) and soy protein concentrates, whereas iron bioavailability from soy protein isolates may be reduced. Within a meal, partial substitution (\u226430%) of meat with soy concentrates and isolates did not meaningfully impair total iron absorption. In all conditions, low phytic acid levels and co-ingestion of ascorbic acid improved the absorption of iron naturally present in soy. Available evidence suggests that soy-based products can provide a meaningful contribution to daily requirements for absorbed iron, especially if phytic acid is below defined thresholds to optimize absorption and/or if products include iron absorption enhancers such as ascorbic acid. Further research is needed to understand the factors affecting iron bioavailability from these products, especially the soy cultivar, the roles of phytoferritin and the protein profiles of different soy protein ingredients, as well as the processes to produce them. Long-term assessments of the impact of soybean-based products on iron status are also warranted.",

The number of subjects in the study was 6,506 adult men. The recommended food score was used to evaluate the overall quality of the diet, and the International Prostate Symptom Score was used to quantify LUTS. Logistic regression analysis was used to derive the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to evaluate the relationship between the dietary quality and LUTS. The influence of age, education, marital history, income, occupation, smoking, drinking, exercise, metabolic syndrome, body mass index (BMI), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was analyzed to determine the net influence of the overall diet quality on LUTS.RESULTSThe group with high overall dietary quality showed a lower incidence of LUTS than the group with relatively lower dietary quality (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79\u20130.99).

In the in vitro experiments, SE treatment effectively suppressed the LPS-induced activation of key signaling pathways, including Akt, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and NF-\u03baB, which are known to play pivotal roles in the inflammatory response. SE was also found to reduce oxidative stress and the production of inflammatory markers in the LPS-stimulated RAW264.7\u2009cells. In the in vivo experiments, the administration of SE (500\u2009mg/kg BW) and metformin (200\u2009mg/kg BW) to high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats effectively improved dyslipidemia, as evidenced by reductions in serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides compared to the untreated diabetic control group. Importantly, SE ameliorated the damage to the vascular endothelium and elastic fibers by downregulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers. Additionally, SE administration attenuated the upregulation of key markers associated with ER stress-mediated apoptotic pathways, with effects comparable to those observed in diabetic rats treated with the standard antidiabetic drug metformin. These findings suggest that SE possesses both anti-inflammatory and vascular protective properties, evident in both in vitro and in vivo studies.",

Due to the unique and often extreme marine conditions, these molecules exhibit distinctive structural features and diverse functional properties, making them promising candidates for therapeutic applications. Marine-derived bioactive peptides, typically consisting of 3 to 40 amino acid residues\u2014though most commonly, 2 to 20\u2014are obtained from parent proteins through chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis, microbial fermentation, or gastrointestinal digestion. Like peptides, protein hydrolysates from collagen, a dominant protein of such materials, play an important role. Peptide bioactivities include antioxidant, antihypertensive, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, and anti-cancer effects as well as immunoregulatory and wound-healing activities. These peptides exert their effects through mechanisms such as enzyme inhibition, receptor modulation, and free radical scavenging, among others. Fish, algae, mollusks, crustaceans, microbes, invertebrates, and marine by-products such as skin, bones, and viscera are some of the key marine sources of bioactive proteins and peptides. The advancements in the extraction and purification processes, e.g., enzymatic hydrolysis, ultrafiltration, ion-exchange chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and molecular docking, facilitate easy identification and purification of such bioactive peptides in greater purity and activity. Despite their colossal potential, their production, scale-up, stability, and bioavailability are yet to be enhanced for industrial applications. Additional work needs to be carried out for optimal extraction processes, to unravel the mechanisms of action, and to discover novel marine sources.

A series of behavioral tests, comprising the sucrose preference, tail suspension, as well as forced swimming tests, were conducted. Levels of LINC00641, miR-323a-3p, and EIF4G2 in hippocampal tissues were measured. Biochemical indices, including 5-HT, NE, and DA, were analyzed. Hippocampal neuron structure and apoptosis were evaluated. The targeting relationship among LINC00641, miR-323a-3p, and EIF4G2 was validated experimentally.ResultsCUMS mice exhibited reduced sucrose preference, prolonged immobilization time in behavioral tests, decreased 5-HT, NE, and DA levels, and increased hippocampal neuron apoptosis. Overexpression of LINC00641 or knockdown of miR-323a-3p significantly alleviated depression-like behaviors and restored monoamine neurotransmitter levels. LINC00641 regulated EIF4G2 expression by targeting miR-323a-3p, while miR-323a-3p and EIF4G2 also modulated depression through LINC00641.ConclusionUpregulation of LINC00641 improves depression-like behaviors and enhances monoamine neurotransmission in CUMS mice via the miR-323a-3p/EIF4G2 axis, underscoring its potent as a therapeutic target for depression.Graphical Abstract\nSupplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10565-025-10015-9.",

Its effects on neuroinflammation and microglial activation remain largely unexplored. Curcumin, a bioactive component isolated from Curcuma longa L., is well known for its ability to reduce microglial activation and pro-inflammatory mediator production and release. While the individual effects of \u03b3-VL and curcumin are well documented, their potential combined effects remain unexplored. This research sought to investigate the possible synergistic effects of \u03b3-VL and curcumin in reducing microglial activation. Methods: Primary rat cortical microglia were pre-treated with \u03b3-VL and curcumin, alone or in combination, before stimulation with LPS. An MTT assay was used to evaluate cell viability, while pro-inflammatory mediators were assessed by real-time PCR and ELISA. Nitric oxide production was evaluated with the Griess assay. SynergyFinder Plus software analyzed potential synergistic effects. Results: The combination of low micromolar concentrations of \u03b3-VL and curcumin synergistically reduced LPS-induced microglial activation. Specifically, the combination exhibited a significantly greater ability to inhibit the production and release of pro-inflammatory factors (such as IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and NO) compared to each compound individually. Mechanistically, the anti-inflammatory activity was attributed to the downregulation of NLRP3 expression, and the reduction in microglial activation was linked to the modulation of the NOX2/Nrf2 signaling pathway. Conclusions: The combination of low micromolar concentrations of \u03b3-VL and curcumin produces synergistic anti-inflammatory effects in microglia by targeting key inflammatory pathways, indicating its potential utility as a treatment strategy for neurodegenerative diseases involving microglial activation.",

Samples and measurements were taken from a feeding trial conducted according to a crossover design with two diets (control and experimental diets), six adult Beagle dogs per diet and two periods of 6 weeks each. The experimental diet, with higher docosahexaenoic (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids contents, decreased plasmatic triglycerides and the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme, also tending to decrease total cholesterol. No effects of diet were observed on serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-8, and IL-12/IL-23 p40, and of the serum levels of the anti-inflammatory adipokine adiponectin. Blood pressure, heart rate and echocardiographic measurements were similar between diets with the only exception of left atrial to aorta diameter ratio that was higher in dogs fed the experimental diet, but without clinical relevance. Diet did not significantly affect fecal immunoglobulin A concentration. Regarding fecal microbiome, Megasphaera was the most abundant genus, followed by Bifidobacterium, Fusobacterium, and Prevotella, being the relative abundances of Fusobacterium and Ileibacterium genera positively affected by the experimental diet. Overall, results from the performed short term trial suggest that shrimp hydrolysate and salmon oil can be replaced by protein hydrolysate and oil from fish by-products without affecting systemic inflammatory markers, cardiac structure and function, but potentially benefiting bacterial genera associated with healthy microbiome. Considering the high DHA and EPA contents and the antioxidant properties of fish oil and hydrolysate, it would be worthwhile in the future to assess their long-term effects on inflammatory markers and their role in spontaneous canine cardiac diseases and to perform metabolomic and metagenomics analysis to elucidate the relevance of microbiota changes in the gut.",

We here showed that TGF-\u03b21 could promote myofibroblast-like differentiation of human NP cells along with an induction of MMP12 expression. Intriguingly, MMP12 knockdown not only ameliorated the myofibroblastic phenotype but also increased chondrogenic marker expression. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the MMP12-mediated acquisition of myofibroblast phenotype was coupled to processes related to fibroblast activation and osteogenesis and to pathways mediated by MAPK and Wnt signaling. Injury induced mouse IDD showed NP fibrosis with marked increase of collagen deposition and \u03b1SMA-expressing cells. In contrast, MMP12-KO mice exhibited largely reduced collagen I and III but increased collagen II and aggrecan deposition, indicating an inhibition of NP fibrosis along with an enhanced cartilaginous matrix remodeling. Consistently, an increase of SOX9+ and CNMD+ but decrease of \u03b1SMA+ NP cells was found in the KO.

The clinical records of a United Kingdom referral hospital were reviewed. Dogs with azotemia or prior glucocorticoid or immunosuppressive treatment were excluded. Dogs diagnosed with PLE that had serum symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) concentrations measured were compared with the matched controls. Signalment, clinical presentation, clinicopathological abnormalities, treatment, and SDMA concentration pre\u2010 (PLE\u2010T0) and post\u2010 (PLE\u2010T1) treatment were recorded.ResultsAt baseline, SDMA concentration was higher in PLE (T0, 15.2\u2009\u00b1\u20092.02\u2009\u03bcg/dL) than in control (11.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.13\u2009\u03bcg/dL) dogs (p\u2009<\u20090.001; Hedge's G, 1.48), but decreased with treatment (PLE\u2010T1: 10.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.78\u2009\u03bcg/dL; T0 vs. T1: p\u2009=\u20090.01, Hedge's G, 1.31). Serum creatinine concentration was similar in PLE (T0, 0.81\u2009\u00b1\u20090.24\u2009\u03bcg/dL) and control (0.85\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26\u2009\u03bcg/dL) dogs at baseline (p\u2009=\u20090.57; Hedge's G, 0.18).

    "content": "The biochemical processes of childhood-onset epilepsy remain unclear, with no reliable biomarkers for prognosis or management. Untargeted plasma metabolomics offers a valuable approach to uncover underlying pathomechanisms and identify actionable biomarkers. In this study, plasma samples from 18 pediatric patients with epilepsy and 11 age-matched healthy controls were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistical methods and pathway enrichment analysis. Multivariate analyses demonstrated separation between the patient and control groups. A total of 19 endogenous metabolites (VIP\u2009>\u20091, adjusted p\u2009<\u20090.05) emerged as key differentiators. Compared with controls, patients exhibited significant reductions in tryptophan (Trp), 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), several gut microbiota-derived metabolites, including indole, indoxyl sulfate, and p-cresyl sulfate, as well as in niacin metabolism end-products - N1-Methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (Met2PY) and N1-Methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide (Met4PY). In addition, patients showed decreased levels of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, concomitant with an increase in fatty acid derivatives and N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). The most substantially altered metabolic pathways in epilepsy patients involved the TCA cycle, vitamin A and C metabolism, prostaglandin synthesis, and D4/E4-neuroprostane formation. Observed alterations in tryptophan and microbiota-derived metabolites suggest gut dysbiosis may contribute to epilepsy development through the gut-brain axis. Moreover, the circulatory metabolic markers indicating an energy deficit and oxidative stress underscore the systemic impact of seizure activity.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-99805-z.",

    "content": "Epilepsy affects 1\u20132% of the world population, is enigmatic in 30% of cases, and is often intractable, unresponsive to antiepileptic drugs, and accompanied by cognitive, psychiatric and behavioral problems. Tests for Autoimmune Epilepsy are not performed routinely, and limited to passive diagnosis of known autoimmune antibodies, without essential functional tests to reveal active pathogenic antibodies. We investigated two young Epilepsy patients with different Epilepsy characteristics, repeated intractable seizures, and enigmatic etiology. We suspected Autoimmune Epilepsy. We found that both patients have elevated IgG antibodies, and three types of glutamate receptor antibodies, to: AMPA-GluR3B, NMDA-NR1 and NMDA-NR2 peptides. In contrast, they lack autoantibodies to: LGI1, CASPR2, GABA-RB1, Amphiphysin, CV2, PNMA1, Ri, Yo, Hu, Recoverin, Soxi and Titin. IgG antibodies of both patients bound and killed human neural cells In vitro. Moreover, In vivo video EEG studies in naive rats revealed that patient\u2019s IgG antibodies, infused continually into rat brain, bound neural cells in the hippocampus and cortex, caused neural loss in these brain regions, and induced recurrent Generalized Tonic Clonic Seizures. We assume they can do so also in the patient\u2019s brain. This is the first model of human Autoimmune Epilepsy in rats. It can serve for discovery of patient\u2019s pathogenic antibodies, and drug development. Tests for autoimmune antibodies that bind glutamate receptor peptides, and functional diagnostic tests, are obligatory in all enigmatic intractable Epilepsy patients. Current diagnosis of Autoimmune Epilepsy is insufficient! If pathogenic antibodies are found, intractable patients must receive available, suitable and potentially life-changing immunotherapies for Autoimmune Epilepsy.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00702-024-02855-2.",

    "content": "BackgroundWild edible plants hold a significant position in the lives of local residents, serving as a primary food source or supplement. Laifeng County, located in the hinterland of the central mountainous area of China, boasts abundant wild edible plant resources. The Tujia people, residing here for generations, have accumulated a wealth of traditional knowledge in the long-term practice of utilizing wild edible plants. The aim of this study is to document and organize the traditional utilization of wild edible plants by the Tujia ethnic group in Laifeng.MethodsAn ethnobotanical investigation, comprising semi-structured interviews, key informant interviews, and participatory observations, was conducted in 26 traditional villages in Laifeng County from May 2023 to June 2024. A total of 252 informants were interviewed, from whom information about wild edible plants, including edible parts, food categories, consumption modes, and multiple uses was collected. The relative frequency of citation (RFC) and the cultural food significance index (CFSI) were calculated to identify the cultural importance of wild edible plants.ResultsA total of 163 species of wild edible plants consumed by the Tujia people in Laifeng, belonging to 64 families and 118 genera and related traditional knowledge were collected, including vegetables (78), fruits (52), wine-soaking plants (12), spices (11), food substitutes (9), tea substitutes (6), nuts (5), coagulants (2), and oil (1). The most frequently used families were Rosaceae, Asteraceae, and Poaceae, with 23, 10, and 10 species, respectively. The most commonly utilized plant parts were fruits, leaves, and stems. RFC and CFSI analyses identified 14 species of wild edible plants with high cultural importance in the local diet, such as Allium\nmacrostemon, Houttuynia\ncordata, and Hovenia\nacerba.ConclusionsThe Tujia ethnic group in Laifeng demonstrates extensive knowledge in their traditional usage of wild edible plants, offering unique and robust insights into the harvesting, processing, and consumption of these resources. Over time, this practice has become an integral part of the local food culture. These findings contribute to the preservation of the Tujia culture of wild edible plants in Laifeng and the conservation and development of wild edible plant resources.",

Healthspan is the length of time an individual is in good health and free from chronic diseases and disabilities associated with aging. Two modifiable factors that can influence healthspan, promote healthy aging, and prevent the development of age-related diseases, are diet and microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract (gut microbiota). This review will discuss how dietary phytochemicals and gut microbiota can work in concert to promote a healthy gut and healthy aging. First, an overview is provided of how the gut microbiota influences healthy aging through its impact on gut barrier integrity, immune function, mitochondria function, and oxidative stress. Next, the mechanisms by which phytochemicals effect gut health, inflammation, and nurture a diverse and healthy microbial composition are discussed. Lastly, we discuss how the gut microbiota can directly influence health by producing bioactive metabolites from phytochemicals in food like urolithin A, equol, hesperetin, and sulforaphane. These and other phytochemical-derived microbial metabolites that may promote healthspan are discussed. Importantly, an individual\u2019s capacity to produce health-promoting microbial metabolites from cruciferous vegetables, berries, nuts, citrus, and soy products will be dependent on the specific bacteria present in the individual\u2019s gut.",

Although past research has focused on independent associations of modifiable risk factors, including cardiovascular disease risk factors using Framingham cardiovascular risk score, physical activity, dietary quality, body mass index, and sleep, on neurodegeneration, the impact of all 5 factors simultaneously in a multimodal model has not been studied. We examined independent associations and an overall combined model with 5 modifiable risk factors with white matter injury, a recognized risk factor for dementia, \u224810 years later in a diverse Hispanic/Latino population.METHODS:Participants were from the HCHS/SOL (Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos) Investigation of Nerocognitive Aging-Magnetic Resonance Imaging longitudinal study (n=2667; clinical visit 1 mean age, 52.01 [8.90] years). We conducted path and mediation analyses across 5 modifiable risk factors obtained at clinical visit 1 (2008\u20132011) and 2 measures of white matter injury (free water and white matter hyperintensity volume) obtained at the magnetic resonance imaging visit (2018\u20132022; mean age, 62.37 [9.23] years). We controlled for age at the time of the dependent variable, sex, education, Hispanic/Latino heritage, overall cognitive status, and b-value when free water was included.RESULTS:We observed 11 significant independent associations across modifiable risk factors and white matter injury measures. The association of Framingham cardiovascular risk score to white matter hyperintensity volume was mediated by free water (indirect mediation: \u03b2=2.473; SE=0.207; P<0.001), and the association of physical activity to body mass index was mediated by sleep duration (indirect mediation: \u03b2=\u22120.038; SE=0.019; P=0.050). We combined the 2 mediational pathways and added diet associated with white matter hyperintensity volume (\u03b2=0.008; SE=0.007; P=0.004) and physical activity associated with Framingham cardiovascular risk score (\u03b2=\u22120.007; SE=0.002; P=0.001) in the overall model.CONCLUSIONS:Our findings identified how modifiable risk factors synergistically influence future white matter injury in Hispanic/Latino populations. Such multimodal models may lead to the development of novel and personalized lifestyle clinical interventions for adults at risk for dementia due to elevated white matter hyperintensity volume.",

Some of the uses are based on the tenet of \u201csimilia similibus\u201d (let likes be cured by likes), but not all non-conventional health promoting practices should be dismissed as superstition or wishful thinking, for they have stood the test of time. Two questions are addressed: how can totally different organ systems in a human possibly benefit from extracts, potions, powders, secretions, ashes, etc. of a single species and how can different target organs, e.g. bronchi, lungs, the urinary bladder, kidneys, etc. apparently respond to a range of taxonomically not even closely related species? Even though therapeutically used invertebrates are generally small, they nevertheless possess organs for specific functions, e.g. digestion, gas exchange, reproduction. They have a nervous system, endocrine glands, a heart and muscle tissue and they contain a multitude of different molecules like metabolites, enzymes, hormones, neurotransmitters, secretions, etc. that have come under increased scientific scrutiny for pharmacological properties. Bearing that in mind it seems likely that a single species prepared and used in different ways could have a multitude of uses. But how, for example, can there be remedies for breathing and other problems, involving earthworms, molluscs, termites, beetles, cockroaches, bugs, and dragonflies? Since invertebrates themselves can suffer from infections and cancers, common defence reactions are likely to have evolved in all invertebrates, which is why it would be far more surprising to find that each species had evolved its own unique disease fighting system. To obtain a more comprehensive picture, however, we still need information on folk medicinal uses of insects and other invertebrates from a wider range of regions and ethnic groups, but this task is hampered by western-based medicines becoming increasingly dominant and traditional healers being unable and sometimes even unwilling to transmit their knowledge to the younger generation. However, collecting and uncontrolled uses of therapeutic invertebrates can put undue pressure on certain highly sought after species and this is something that has to be borne in mind as well.",

This cross-sectional study was conducted in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from August 2024 to July 2024. The study included 509 participants aged\u2005\u2265\u200518years, recruited through an online questionnaire distributed on social media platforms. The questionnaire assessed demographic characteristics, presence of chronic diseases, prior diagnosis of gout, sources of information, and knowledge about gout. Knowledge scores were categorized into \u201cgood\u201d (\u226560%) or \u201cpoor\u201d (<60%) based on the participants\u2019 responses. Among the 509 respondents, 49.7% were aged 18 to 30 years, 75.4% were female, and 87.8% were Saudi nationals. The majority (70.3%) had a university-level education, and 28.1% were employed. Chronic diseases were reported by 16.9% of the participants, with hypertension being the most common, and 28.3% were obese. A total of 6.3% of participants reported a prior diagnosis of gout. The most common sources of information were the Internet and social media (40.5%), followed by family and friends (35.2%). Regarding knowledge, 79.8% had heard of gout, and 64% correctly identified excessive red meat consumption as a cause. Symptoms such as joint pain (67%) and joint swelling (44%) were the most commonly recognized. Preventive measures such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle and reducing meat intake were reported by 60.7% of participants. The mean knowledge score was 7.78\u2005\u00b1\u20052.79, with 83.7% classified as having poor knowledge and 16.3% with good knowledge. No significant relationships were found between knowledge level and participants\u2019 demographics, sources of information, or previous diagnosis of gout (P\u2005>\u2005.05). However, participants without chronic diseases had significantly better knowledge about gout (P\u2005<\u2005.05).

    "content": "BackgroundAn excessively reactive immune system results in the cytokine storm COVID-19. A healthy diet is essential to maintain the balance between the immune system and inflammatory and oxidative stress. Associations between single foods and nutrients and COVID-19 have been examined. However, no prior study has examined associations between nutrient patterns and COVID-19. This study assessed the link between nutrient patterns and the COVID-19 severity and length of hospital stay in Iranian adults.MethodsThis cross-sectional study included 107 Iranian adults aged 20\u201360\u202fyears, who were admitted to Amir Alam Hospital in Tehran, Iran, due to COVID-19. Data on their symptoms were collected through a demographic questionnaire and verified against their hospital records. Three non-consecutive 24-h dietary recalls were used to collect participants\u2019 food and beverage intake. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to derive nutrient patterns.ResultA total of 95 Covid patients with a mean age of 46.2\u202fyears were included. Four major dietary patterns were identified using the Scree Plot chart, including high carbohydrate and high minerals pattern; high protein and high vitamins pattern; high fat pattern; and poor nutrient pattern. Adherence to the poor nutrient patterns was associated with a higher number of hospitalization days and lower appetite (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The poor dietary patterns were associated with an increased likelihood of headache, fever, and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Also, headaches were more common with adherence to the high-fat pattern (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).ConclusionThe findings of this study show that a poor nutrient pattern is related to longer hospital stays and reduced appetite. It also connected to an increased likelihood of symptoms including headaches, fever, and respiratory distress syndrome. A strong association was found between respiratory distress syndrome, headaches, and a high-fat diet was found. Further studies with prospective designs are needed to better understand and validate these findings.",

We aimed to investigate the association between the triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein (TG/HDL) ratio, a simple and validated biomarker for insulin resistance, and the incidence of gout in a longitudinal setting in the general population.MethodsOur study was conducted using the National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort database of Republic of Korea (2002\u20132019). We included 300,107 participants who had no previous history of gout and had data for more than three repeated measurements of the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index. The incidence of gout was determined using at least two or more claims of the ICD-10 code M10.ResultsDuring a median 9.62 years (interquartile range 8.72\u201310.53), 14,116 individuals (4.72%) had a reported incidence of gout. In a fully adjusted multivariable time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model with repeated measures of the TyG index, a unit increase in the index significantly increased the risk of gout in the entire cohort (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.150, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.116\u20131.184). In a multivariable Cox proportional model of average TyG index quartiles, comparison of the lowest (Q1) and highest quartiles (Q4) indicated a significant positive association with the incidence of gout (HR: 1.326, 95% CI: 1.260\u20131.397). This association was non-linear (J-shape) when assessing the entire cohort and the diabetes and non-diabetes cohorts.ConclusionOur study demonstrated that increased TyG index was associated with an incidence risk of gout in the general population. Additionally, this association was non-linear (J-shape) not only in the entire cohort, but also in diabetes mellitus and non-diabetes mellitus cohorts. The TyG index may be an important predictor of gout.",

Therefore, considering the high prevalence of obesity and its complications, and considering that dietary patterns are different in different populations and geographical locations, the present study aims to identify and investigate the relationship between dietary patterns and obesity diseases in the adult population of the Hovizeh city.Method5821 participants (2076 obese group and 3745 not obese group) from Hoveyzeh cohort study for this case-control study were chosen. Data related to dietary, demographic, anthropometric, and physical activity information were obtained through a questionnaire. Dietary patterns were identified using factor analysis. The logistic regression method with adjustment for demographic factors, energy intake, physical activity, and blood pressure and diabetic medication was used to determine the relationship between significant food patterns and obesity.ResultsIn this study, four major food patterns were identified: 1) Healthy dietary pattern characterized by a high intake of vegetables and high-protein foods,2) Traditional Defined by high consumption of green vegetables, onions, garlic, fruits, refined grains, white meat, liquid oils, and tomatoes, 3) Sweets and snacks, 4) Good oils. Although there was a significant association between sweets and snacks pattern and obesity risk in the crude model (P\u2009<\u20090.05), this association was no longer significant after adjusting for confounding factors. Good oils pattern showed a significant relationship with obesity in the crud and first adjusted model (P\u2009<\u20090.05), but this association was also not significant after adjusting for blood pressure and diabetes medication use. None of these dietary patterns were significantly associated with obesity or other anthropometric indicators after full adjustments for confounders.ConclusionIdentifying dietary patterns that influence obesity within a population helps inform strategies for obesity prevention and management. However, in this study, no significant association was found between the identified dietary patterns and obesity.Clinical trial numberNot applicable.",

Using a multi-omics approach, we investigated how almond snacking counters gut imbalances linked to adiposity and an average American Diet (AAD). Fifteen adults with overweight or obesity underwent a randomized, crossover-controlled feeding trial comparing a 4-week AAD with a similar isocaloric diet supplemented with 42.5\u2009g/day of almonds (ALD). Almond snacking increases functional gut microbes, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, while suppressing opportunistic pathogens, thereby favorably modulating gut microecological niches through symbiotic and microbe-metabolite interactions. Moreover, ALD elevates health-beneficial monosaccharides and fosters bacterial consumption of amino acids, owing to enhanced microbial homeostasis. Additionally, ALD enhances metabolic homeostasis through a ketosis-like effect, reduces inflammation, and improves satiety-regulating hormones. The findings suggest that prudent dietary choices, such as almond snacking, promote gut microbial homeostasis while modulating immune metabolic state.",

Secreted mainly by plants, PDEVs outperform human cell-derived extracellular vesicles in safety, stability, and biocompatibility, serving as valuable tools for exploring disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets. However, crucial issues in this field demand immediate attention. Existing extraction techniques are inadequate and inefficient, failing to meet the needs of large-scale, high-quality extraction. Regarding pharmacological effects, there is a lack of thorough understanding of PDEVs\u2019 in vivo mechanisms, efficacy, and potential side effects. These knowledge and technological gaps impede the clinical application and promotion of PDEVs. Therefore, resolving these issues is vital for advancing related fields and refining diagnostic and treatment strategies.

    "content": "Sodium is the major cation of extracellular fluid (ECF) and, because of its osmotic action, is involved in the regulation of ECF volume and blood pressure. The ingested sodium is almost completely absorbed by the intestine. Circulating sodium is filtered by the glomeruli and its renal tubular handling is responsible for the maintenance of sodium and water balance. Sodium deficiency is rare and occurs only in some medical conditions. High dietary sodium intake is associated with ECF volume expansion and is a leading risk factor for hypertension and cardiovascular diseases; it also adds to risk of gastric cancer, nephrolithiasis, reduced bone mineral density, and osteoporosis. Salt added while cooking and eating, the amount added during food transformation, and that occurring naturally in foods contribute to the dietary sodium intake. Additional small amounts of sodium may be occasionally acquired through oral or parenteral medications. The National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine set an adequate intake of 1.5 g and a chronic disease risk reduction intake of 2.3 g of sodium per day for the adult population. The European Food Safety Authority and the World Health Organization set a standard dietary target for sodium of 2 g/d (5 g of salt). Recent studies highlighted the relevance of salt intake reduction for all-cause mortality risk and, in particular, for stroke. Sodium also appears to affect the activity of the immune system by influencing the gut microbiota composition and the macrophage and lymphocyte differentiation.",

    "content": "Background: The ketogenic diet has been successfully used in the last 100 years in the treatment of epilepsy and other neurological disorders. In recent decades, it gained wider application in the treatment of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. However, there have been only a few studies on its use in children with obesity and associated metabolic disorders. Objectives: To determine the clinical and metabolic effects of a well-formulated low-carbohydrate (ketogenic) diet in children with obesity. Methods: One hundred children with obesity and metabolic disorders underwent initial anthropometric, laboratory, and ultrasound examinations. They were placed on a well-formulated ketogenic diet and monitored for 4 months. The 58 patients who completed the study underwent follow-up examinations to assess the effects of the diet on anthropometric, clinical, and laboratory markers of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance, cardiovascular risk factors, and certain hormone levels. Compliance with the diet, common difficulties in adhering to it, side effects, and positive changes in the patients\u2019 health were analyzed. Results: At the end of the study, the average weight loss for the entire group was 6.45 kg, with a reduction in BMI of 3.12 kg/m2. Significant improvements were also observed in insulin resistance indicators, including fasting insulin levels, HOMA-IR index, QUICKI (p < 0.0001), and adiponectin (p = 0.04). The cases of hepatosteatosis decreased twofold, the number of patients with arterial hypertension was significantly reduced, as well as the number of children receiving antihypertensive therapy. Additionally, the number of patients meeting the criteria for metabolic syndrome decreased threefold. Conclusions: A well-formulated short-term ketogenic diet is effective in treating obesity, metabolic syndrome, and related comorbidities, and can be part of a comprehensive approach for these patients.",

In each of these cohorts, we assessed the incidence of KC 2010 through 2021 by NSAID exposure as defined by repeated prescriptions. We also evaluated KC mortality in individuals treated (vs. not) with NSAIDs, taking the cancer stage into account. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated through Cox regression, taking age, sex, educational level, comorbidities and family history of KC into account.ResultsBased on 751 incident cases of KC among 393,709 individuals in the general population (33% NSAID\u2010exposed), the HR for NSAID\u2010exposure was 1.32 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13\u20131.54), with the highest HRs during the first year of follow\u2010up (HR thereafter 1.20).

A narrative review was done, and tool characteristics, accuracy, validation, and applicability were collected and summarized.Results:Sixty-two articles (with 16 different PROMs) were included in the final review. These included generic tools such as the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey and specific tools like the Acute Cystitis Symptom Score and Recurrent Urinary Tract Infection Impact Questionnaire, amongst others. While scoring systems seemed to be used for severe infections such as Fournier\u2019s gangrene and emphysematous pyelonephritis, nomograms were primarily used for diagnosis and risk prediction. PROMs are useful tools and have utility within the management of patients with UTIs, but further clarity is needed as to which of these tools is most appropriate for each type of UTI as each offer their respective advantages and disadvantages.Conclusion:This atlas is the first comprehensive review of PROMs, scoring systems and nomograms in the management of UTIs. While PROMs improve patient care, further standardisation, external validation and accuracy are needed. While nomograms and scoring systems can help clinicians, these must be tailored to individual patients based on their specific clinical scenarios.Trial registration:PROSPERO registration number CRD42025625865.",

In this study, seeds of the peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) variety \u201cSilihong\u201d were selected as the experimental materials. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses of the peanut kernels at day 0 (S0d), day 1 (S1d), day 3 (S3d), day 5 (S5d), and day 7 (S7d) of drying were performed to search for the genes that controlled the storage compounds. A total of 165 differentially expressed metabolites (DAMs) and 15,010 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the five stages of seed drying were identified. S3d was the key period during which the content of most of the metabolites changed significantly. The contents of most amino acids(87%) and their derivatives decreased significantly, and most of the lipids(68%), sugars(67%) and flavonoids(87%) accumulated to their peak at S3d. A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that the DEGs were primarily enriched in four aspects, including amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism, lipid biosynthesis and metabolism, sucrose and starch metabolism, and flavonoid biosynthesis. Crucial genes that potentially regulate the storage substances were identified, including PAL, FAD2, SUS, LOX, and PFK. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the molecular regulation of storage compounds in peanut seeds and may help to assess edible peanuts that have enhanced nutritional and economic values.",

Several studies have shown that a higher intake of omega-3 fatty acids is associated with a lower risk of developing diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Reviewing clinical trials and observational studies that support the protective role of omega-3s in retinal disorders is essential. This comprehensive review aims to evaluate the current literature on the role of omega-3 fatty acids, exploring their mechanisms of action and anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and neuroprotective roles in the retina. Omega-3s have been shown to inhibit abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina, which is a significant factor in proliferative diabetic retinopathy and neovascular AMD. Furthermore, omega-3 fatty acids are often studied with other nutrients, such as lutein, zeaxanthin, and vitamins, for their synergistic effects on retinal health. Reviewing these combinations can help understand how omega-3s can be part of a comprehensive approach to preventing or treating retinopathies, especially in diabetic patients.

Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed.Results:Four themes emerged. (1) \u201cAntidepressants at the pharmacy: a persistent taboo\u201d showed pharmacists\u2019 hesitancy to initiate discontinuation discussions due to societal stigma and fear of being perceived as nosy. (2) \u201cBalancing risks vs benefits\u201d highlights that pharmacists were primarily concerned about relapse in stable patients but recognized that a patient request from a patient experiencing side effects may facilitate discontinuation. (3) \u201cIs this my role?,\u201d pharmacists viewed GPs as the primary decision-makers in discontinuation, limiting their role to supporting GP treatment decisions. Key facilitators for discontinuation included a GP\u2019s decision to stop and a motivated patient. Regular reviews by the pharmacist could also facilitate the discontinuation process. (4) Optimizing pharmacists\u2019 role\u2019 with a strong need for GP collaboration, and acknowledging a need to optimize knowledge and skills to support antidepressant discontinuation.Conclusion:Our study reveals that pharmacists viewed GPs as pivotal in the discontinuation process, as they make the decisions, while they see their role as supportive, following the doctor\u2019s decision. However, they faced significant barriers to discontinuing long-term antidepressants, including fear of relapse, societal taboo, and unclear responsibilities.

The current study aimed to investigate apoptosis/anti-apoptotic markers in the heart tissue of rats fed with a HFD.Materials and Methods: Twenty-four male Wistar rats (weighing approximately 180 grams) were randomly divided into three groups (n=8 each group), including the control group (C), the high-fat diet group (HFD), and the high-fat diet + carvacrol group (HFD + Carva). Animals received a standard or HFD to induce obesity for three months. From day 61 to 90 in the HFD+Carva group, carvacrol was injected intraperitoneally (50 mg/kg) every other day. At the end of the study, the heart tissue was examined for pathological changes and the mRNA levels of TNF-\u03b1, Bcl2, Bax, and caspase3 in the heart tissue by Real Time-PCR.Results:HFD-induced obesity led to increased TNF-\u03b1, caspase-3, and Bax and decreased Bcl-2 expression levels in heart tissue. Furthermore, histopathological changes in intracytoplasmic vacuole accumulation were evident in the HFD-obese animals. Carvacrol treatment significantly decreased the expression of Bax, TNF-\u03b1, and caspase-3 and increased the expression of Bcl-2 in heart tissue.Conclusion:In the findings, carvacrol was found to decrease the histopathological changes caused by HFD in heart tissue by suppressing the expression of genes involved in the apoptosis pathway.",

    "content": "Background/Objectives: Numerous studies have highlighted the nutritional imbalances that are commonly observed in children and adolescents diagnosed with celiac disease (CD) who follow a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, the development and timeline of these nutritional deficiencies remain unclear. The aim of the present study is to investigate the short-term (\u22656 months to <12 months) and long-term (\u226512 months) association between adherence to a GFD and nutrient intake as well as micronutrient blood status in children and adolescents aged from 0 to 18 years with CD. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in PubMed and Scopus for observational studies published up to June 2024. Results: A total of 15 studies (case\u2013control, cross-sectional, and prospective studies) with 2004 children and adolescents were included. Their quality was assessed using the ROBINS-E tool. Despite the lack of high-quality data and the heterogeneity of the methods used in the included studies, the results of the cross-sectional/case\u2013control studies show that, in the short term, children and adolescents with CD consumed excessive amounts of protein and carbohydrates compared to controls. After long-term adherence to a GFD, significant changes in the diets of children and adolescents with CD persisted. Fat intake was higher, while protein intake remained excessive compared to controls. Based on prospective studies, vitamin C and iodine intake improved both in the short and long term after adherence to a GFD. However, most other nutrients either remain inadequate or continue to decline, indicating that it is difficult to meet nutrient requirements despite dietary adjustments. Conclusions: Gaps in adherence to dietary recommendations appear to be widespread in children and adolescents with CD, emphasizing the need for improved diet quality and regular monitoring.",

This review aimed to investigate the effect of acute and chronic stress, associated with hypertension, on the skeletal system. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases, focusing on peer-reviewed articles published in English. We include experimental, clinical, and peer-reviewed studies focused on the relationship between stress, hypertension, and bone resorption. Searches were conducted in MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase and Scopus, with the last search completed on 10 September 2024. Results: The main topics include situations that favor bone loss, such as psychological stress, which can lead to osteoporotic fractures through immunological and endocrine mechanisms. The relationship between psychological stress and loss of bone density, as in osteoporosis, occurs due to the reduction in the number of osteoblasts and loss in the balance between physiological formation/resorption. Conclusions: Chronic stress significantly affects cardiovascular health and bone resorption. This narrative review study highlights the vulnerability of the skeletal system, along with the cardiovascular system, to prolonged stress, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary strategies in preventing stress-related conditions. Effective stress management can help reduce the risks of cardiovascular disease and bone resorption, emphasizing their role in comprehensive health care.",

Diabetes is a common cause of CKD, and both diabetes and CKD increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death in individuals with CKD. This review will discuss the importance of early detection of CKD and prompt pharmacological intervention to slow CKD progression and delay the development of CVD for improving outcomes.Early CKD is often asymptomatic, and diagnosis usually requires laboratory testing. The combination of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin\u2010to\u2010creatinine ratio (UACR) measurements is used to diagnose and determine CKD severity. Guidelines recommend at least annual screening for CKD in at\u2010risk individuals. While eGFR testing rates are consistently high, rates of UACR testing remain low. This results in underdiagnosis and undertreatment of CKD, leaving many individuals at risk of CKD progression and CVD. UACR testing is an actionable component of the CKD definition.A four\u2010pillar treatment approach for slowing the progression of diabetic kidney disease is suggested, comprising a renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013system (RAS) inhibitor, a sodium\u2013glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, a glucagon\u2010like peptide 1 receptor agonist, and the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone. The combination of these agents provides a greater cardiorenal risk reduction compared with RAS inhibitors alone.Early detection of CKD and prompt intervention with guideline\u2010directed medical therapy are crucial for reducing CVD risk in individuals with CKD and diabetes. Evidence from ongoing studies will advance our understanding of optimal therapy in this population.",

Studies have shown that elderly people often exhibit a slowing gait before dementia diagnosis, which is linked to cognitive decline and predicts dementia risk. With 30% of those over 65 years of age experiencing falls annually, managing fall risk is essential. Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR), characterized by subjective memory impairment and slow gait, is a pre-dementia condition that can identify high-risk individuals without extensive evaluation. The prevalence of MCR varies globally and is associated with an increased risk of falls, disability, and death. Early screening and intervention for MCR can delay dementia and improve fall regulation, offering a new perspective on elderly health management.

We hypothesized that laser therapy would accelerate healing by stimulating early neovascularization and osteoblast recruitment.MethodsA total of 54 male Sprague-Dawley rats received intramedullary Kirschner wire (K-wire) osteosynthesis following femoral osteotomy, and were randomly divided into two groups (n = 27 each): the control group, and the laser group that received daily pulsed Nd:YAG laser for ten days immediately after osteotomy. Fracture sites were assessed using micro-CT (\u03bcCT; n = 8 at each timepoint), histology (n = 4), and three-point bending tests (n = 4) at week 2, week 4, and week 6, respectively. At week 2, an additional three rats per group were selected for the western blot tests.ResultsCompared to controls, the laser group showed higher vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), CD31, and Runx2 protein expression, and significantly higher neovascular area density and osteoblast density (p = 0.025 and p = 0.008, respectively) at week 2. At week 4, the laser treatment led to higher histological fracture healing scale and flexural modulus, and less strain (p = 0.001, p = 0.020, and p = 0.004, respectively).

    "content": "BackgroundOsteoarthritis (OA) is an age-related degenerative disease that affects bones and joints. The hallmark pathogenesis of OA is associated with chondrocyte senescence. Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is a member of the innate immune proteins family, which can inhibit the immune inflammatory response of chondrocytes. However, the effect of SP-D on chondrocyte senescence phenotype is poorly studied. The present study investigated the phenotypic regulation of OA chondrocyte senescence mediated by SP-D and explored the underlying molecular mechanism.MethodsIn this study, an in vitro senescence chondrocyte model was generated by subjecting chondrocytes to IL-1\u03b2 treatment. Furthermore, the expression of aging-related biomarkers and mitochondrial functions in SP-D overexpressing chondrocytes was observed. Co-immunoprecipitation was conducted to verify the association between SP-D and the identifed proteins within chondrocytes. Moreover, a rat OA model was established by destabilization of the medial meniscus surgery, and the effect of SP-D on reversing the aging phenotype of OA cartilage was investigated.ResultsThe results indicated that SP-D significantly decreased senescence and enhanced mitochondrial functions in senescent chondrocytes. The RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that the SIRT3/SOD2 pathway predominantly modulated the effect of SP-D on alleviating senescence. In addition, SP-D overexpression mitigated chondrocyte senescence, suppressed senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) secretion and ameliorated mitochondrial damage. In the rat OA model, SP-D inhibited aging-related pathological changes by upregulating SIRT3/SOD2 pathway, thereby protecting the cartilage tissue integrity.ConclusionThese findings indicate that SP-D modulates the inhibition of chondrocyte senescence by upregulating SIRT3/SOD2 pathway. These data indicate that targeting SP-D and the SIRT3/SOD2 pathway might be a promising therapeutic strategy for OA.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s10020-025-01221-6.",

    "content": "Soil-borne diseases lead to high risk in crop production by diminishing the productivity and general health of the affected plants. Brassica plants are known to produce glucosinolates, which, upon decomposition, release bioactive isothiocyanates (ITCs). ITCs have attracted attention because of their biofumigation properties, effectively suppressing soil-borne pathogens and pests, promising natural solutions for managing soil-borne diseases. ITCs produced by Brassica plants or seed meal additives to soil have the ability to reduce soil-borne pests and diseases while increasing beneficial soil microbiota. Several researchers have indicated that ITCs can interfere with the life cycles of soil-borne pathogens and, at the same time, strengthen plant defense systems, which makes them a more environmentally friendly option than chemical pesticides. The breakdown of Brassica biomass has also been shown to stimulate beneficial microbial communities, which play a key role in nutrient availability and pathogen suppression. Studies indicate that this process enhances the availability of essential nutrients like sulfur and nitrogen in the soil, both of which are critical for plant growth and development. This review provides a comprehensive exploration of the role of Brassica ITCs in mitigating soil-borne diseases. We aim to consolidate current knowledge on ITC-mediated biofumigation, recommend strategies for enhancing its efficiency in practical applications, and highlight the need for future research to optimize its long-term effectiveness in sustainable agriculture.",

    "content": "Background: Lipid-lowering therapies are an option for stabilizing lipid levels. Icosapent ethyl (IPE) is a highly purified formulation of eicosapentaenoic acid, which can reduce lipid action, improve plaque stabilization, reduce platelet aggregation, lower TG, and prevent cardiovascular events. IPE is frequently used with statins to manage elevated TG levels. However, the evidence on IPE as a lipid-lowering agent is limited, and no updated systematic review and meta-analysis have been published considering the recent advancements in the field and newly published studies. Therefore, we aim to fill this gap. Methods: We used the PRISMA guidelines and the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) framework to conduct this review, aiming to answer the question, \u201cCan IPE benefit patients at cardiovascular risk?\u201d GRADE was used to evaluate evidence levels to adhere to the highest criteria. Results: Predominantly, the evaluated population presented TG levels between \u2265135 mg/dL and 500 mg/dL and LDL-C levels between >40 mg/dL and \u2264100 mg/dL. The included studies showed a reduction in TG and LDL-C and a decrease in cardiovascular events. It means that, according to our systematic review evidence analysis, IPE has been effective in lowering blood lipid levels, including TG, and reducing cardiovascular death and events, such as non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for unstable angina. However, it is worth noting that these results were primarily from patients undergoing statin therapy. According to our meta-analysis, IPE may not be considered a lipid-lowering drug, as limited action associated with its use was evident in the quantitative results. However, caution is necessary, as only two studies were suitable for inclusion due to the differing outcomes in the analyzed samples. Conclusions: Despite the quantitative synthesis, IPE possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and anti-atherogenic properties, highly related to cardiovascular protection. Based on our included studies, IPE was considered a promising therapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in conjunction with other lipid-lowering therapies, particularly statins, for patients with extremely high TG levels. The limitations of the reviewed studies may include small sample sizes, varying outcomes, and a small duration of interventions. Future clinical trials with similar outcomes, sample sizes, and intervention durations must be designed, and updated meta-analyses must be published in the following years to fully assess the effects of IPE as a lipid-lowering and cardiovascular protector drug.",

    "content": "Simple SummaryHigh-fat diets (HFDs) are becoming increasingly prevalent and are a major contributor to the rising incidence of obesity and metabolic disorders, including diabetes and heart disease. At the same time, exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) from medical procedures, environmental sources, and occupational settings remains a significant public concern. This review explores the interplay between HFDs and IR, focusing on their combined effects on metabolism, immune function, and DNA repair mechanisms. We found that HFDs can exacerbate radiation-induced damage by increasing oxidative stress, inflammation, and DNA damage, potentially elevating the risk of chronic diseases. Surprisingly, in some cases, HFDs also trigger cellular changes that reduce the efficacy of radiation therapy in cancer treatment. Furthermore, maternal HFD exposure can increase radiation sensitivity in offspring, particularly males, by disrupting immune and metabolic functions. Understanding the influence of diet on radiation response is crucial for developing effective public health strategies. The timing and composition of dietary intake in the context of radiation exposure are key considerations for optimizing public health interventions, improving cancer treatment outcomes, and minimizing radiation-related health risks. We encourage collaborative dietary and lifestyle interventions aimed at reducing chronic disease risk and enhancing health outcomes, particularly among vulnerable populations. This review provides evidence to guide such efforts toward improved health and therapeutic outcomes.",

    "content": "Aging is a very complex process, and it has been linked with Sirtuins. Sirtuin enzymes are a family of deacetylases that are related to caloric restriction and aging by modulating energy metabolism, genomic stability, and stress resistance. Up to now, seven sirtuins have been recognized. This narrative review aimed to analyze the literature produced between January 2005 and March 2025 to evaluate the role of sirtuins in chronic kidney disease and, as heart and kidney diseases are strictly interrelated, to explore their role in heart diseases and cardio-renal cross-talk. A reciprocal relationship between CKD and aging seems to exist since CKD may contribute to premature biological aging of different organ systems. SIRTs are involved in the pathophysiology of renal diseases; their activation can delay the progression of several renal diseases. Notably, an increasing number of studies linked SIRTs with different CVDs. SIRTs affect the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) by modulating mitochondrial function. The imbalance of SIRT levels may increase the vulnerability to CVDs. SIRTs are involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of HFpEF (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction) through different signaling pathways. Fibrosis is the linkage mechanism between the heart and kidney in the development of cardio-renal diseases. Current studies on sirtuins, resveratrol, and cardiorenal disease highlight their potential therapeutic benefits in regulating blood pressure, kidney function, lipid profiles, and inflammation, making them a promising area of investigation for improving cardiovascular and renal health outcomes. However, significant gaps remain. The limited availability of highly selective and potent sirtuin modulators hampers their clinical translation, as most existing compounds exhibit poor bioavailability and suboptimal pharmacokinetic properties.",

The most active antifungal fraction was purified by chromatography and characterized by NMR and mass spectrometry. The antifungal activity was evaluated against five Candida strains according to referenced guidelines. Cytotoxicity against fibroblast cells was determined. The likely targets of Candida albicans cells were assessed through interactions with ergosterol and cell wall composition, porosity and architecture. The chemical major component within the most active antifungal fraction of P. cauliflora leaves identified was the hydrolysable tannin casuarinin. The cytotoxic concentration was higher than the antifungal one. The first indication of plant target on cellular integrity was suggested by the antifungal activity ameliorated when using an osmotic support. The most important target for the tannin fraction studied was suggested by ultrastructural analysis of yeast cell walls revealing a denser mannan outer layer and wall porosity reduced. It is possible to imply that P. cauliflora targeted the C. albicans cell wall inducing some changes in the architecture, notably the outer glycoprotein layer, affecting the cell wall porosity without alteration of the polysaccharide or protein level.",

Fingerstick glucose monitoring (FSGM), the standard measurement of glucose, can be painful for patients and time-consuming for nursing staff, especially with hourly monitoring around surgery. Continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) offer a less invasive alternative with better glucose regulation in outpatients.The GLUCOSENS study compares the effects of CGMS and FSGM on point-of-care measurements and time-in-range (3.9\u201310.0 mmol/l) glucose levels (primary outcome), patient satisfaction and experience and nursing staff workload and experience in surgical wards. Furthermore, it evaluates CGMS accuracy during perioperative periods and medical imaging.Methods and analysisThis Danish two-centre study will be conducted at the general surgical wards of Odense and Zealand University Hospital and will involve 305 patients over 18 months. The study is divided into three periods: first, a standard care period with point-of-care FSGM (110 patients); second, an intervention period with point-of-care CGMS (110 patients); third, another standard care period with point-of-care FSGM combined with a blinded sensor for comparing continuous glucose data from this period with continuous glucose data from the intervention period (85 patients). Furthermore, the study will include 24 nursing staff.Data will be collected through medical file reviews on glucose levels, patient satisfaction questionnaires, a patient field study, an observation study of the nursing staff\u2019s workload and qualitative interviews of nursing staff.Ethics and disseminationThe study is registered with the Records of Processing Activities in the Region of Southern Denmark for research and quality projects (ID number: 23/36734) and has been approved by the Regional Scientific Ethical Committee in Southern Denmark (ID number: S-20240041).

Participants were recruited through the Rare Dementia Support Network (target N\u2009=\u200930). Data were collected through online interviews and self-report, including pre and post-intervention measures of depression, anxiety, burden and resilience. A modified version of the NoMAD questionnaire evaluated acceptability of implementation. Scores range from 0 to 4 with\u2009>\u2009/\u2009=\u20092.5 indicating acceptability. Usability was assessed through self-report and data from Blackboard.ResultsThirty-four (13 males and 21 females) carers of people with frontotemporal dementia, posterior cortical atrophy, primary progressive aphasia or Lewy body dementia consented to the study and given access to iSupport RDC, hosted online by Blackboard Learn. Their ethnicity was reported as white and their mean age was 64.2 (range 35\u201386). N\u2009=\u200924 completed pre and post outcome measures, N\u2009=\u200910 completed pre-intervention and then withdrew, n\u2009=\u20094 reporting technical difficulties (70.6% completion rate).

    "content": "AbstractWith an increasing focus on healthier dietary alternatives, this study developed a protein\u2010rich, ready\u2010to\u2010cook flatbread premix using millet, pulse, and oilseed flours. The premix offers a balanced nutritional profile, providing high protein content (\u223c21%) and delivering 423\u00a0kcal/100 g. It demonstrated phenolic content of 0.98\u00a0mg catechin equivalents/gram of premix, which increased to 1.90\u00a0mg catechin equivalents/gram of cooked (lyophilized) product.Antioxidant activity was evaluated through DPPH radical scavenging, yielding values of 5.28\u00a0nmol Trolox equivalents per gram for the premix and 4.82\u00a0nmol Trolox equivalents per gram for the cooked product. Similarly, hydroxyl radical scavenging activity was measured at 4.38\u00a0\u00b5mol Trolox equivalents per gram for the premix and 4.36\u00a0\u00b5mol Trolox equivalents per gram for the cooked product. The product was highly acceptable in sensory evaluations, indicating strong potential for consumer adoption. In vivo studies with Balb/c mice revealed no adverse effects on oxidative stress levels or immune function. The flatbread promoted a healthy gut microbiota composition, supporting gut health while maintaining cellular oxidative balance. Hematological analyses showed improved white blood cell and lymphocyte counts, reflecting enhanced immune resilience.These findings highlight the premix as a promising dietary alternative to traditional carbohydrate\u2010rich staples. With its nutrient density and functional benefits, the flatbread premix offers a practical solution for improving dietary habits and addressing lifestyle\u2010related health concerns. This study underscores the importance of incorporating such functional foods into daily diets to promote better health and prevent nutrition\u2010related disorders. Further research is warranted to explore its broader health impacts over extended durations.Practical ApplicationThe ready\u2010to\u2010cook flatbread premix made from millets, pulses, and oilseeds offers a simple and nutritious way to enhance daily diets.

Protein quality, determined via three in vitro protein digestibility methods, starch, and phenolic content were determined in pre- and post-cooked samples using established methods. Pulses contained 20\u201326% protein, and cooking improved protein digestibility on average by 14.0 \u00b1 2.5% (p < 0.05). However, notable differences in digestibility were observed: it was higher in static assays (pH-Drop and pH-Stat) than in the two-step digestibility assay. Average protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score (IVPDCAAS) among cooked pulses was 0.81 \u00b1 0.14, with the highest in cranberry bean (0.82) and cowpea (0.88). Cooking modified pulse starch profiles by increasing total digestible starch. However, resistant starch and slowly digestible starch fractions accounted for approximately 20\u201325% of total cooked starch content. While total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity were reduced with cooking, they were within expected ranges for cooked pulse flours; however, they were higher in bean (P. vulgaris) varieties than cowpea and pigeon pea. These findings support the promotion of increased pulse consumption in Caribbean diets. Home cooking is a simple method to enhance pulse protein quality through enhancing digestibility; however, in vitro protein digestibility assays may require further standardization.",

Recent research suggests that sleep disorders, such as insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome, may influence the development of gallstones through various metabolic pathways. Depression, often accompanying sleep disorders, may play a mediating role in this relationship. This study uses data from the 2017\u20132020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to explore the potential mediating role of depression in the association between sleep disorders and gallstones.MethodsWe analyzed data from 7,868 adults aged 20 and older from NHANES 2017\u20132020. Gallstones were defined based on self-reported medical diagnoses. Sleep disorders were assessed through self-reported sleep difficulties, and depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale. Logistic regression models evaluated direct associations between sleep disorders, depressive symptoms, and gallstones. Causal mediation analysis further examined the mediating role of depressive symptoms. Finally, subgroup analyses were performed by age, sex, and obesity status.ResultsBoth sleep disorders (OR = 2.00; 95% CI, 1.73-2.32; P<0.001) and depressive symptoms (OR = 2.09; 95% CI, 1.70-2.56; P<0.001) were significantly associated with gallstones, with results remaining significant after adjusting for confounders. A significant association was also observed between sleep disorders and depressive symptoms (OR = 5.53; 95% CI, 4.71-6.50; P<0.001). Mediation analysis indicated that depressive symptoms partially mediate the relationship between sleep disorders and gallstones, with an average causal mediation effect (ACME) of 0.00720 (95% CI, 0.00299-0.01220; P<0.001) and an average direct effect (ADE) of 0.0305 (95% CI, 0.0129-0.0488; P<0.001). Depression mediates 18.89% (95% CI, 0.0704-0.4096; P<0.001) of the association between sleep disorders and gallstones. Subgroup analyses showed significant mediation by depressive symptoms in individuals aged 40-59, males, and both obese and non-obese groups (all P<0.05), although no significant mediation was found in females (P>0.05).ConclusionThis study demonstrates a significant association between sleep disorders and gallstones, with depressive symptoms playing a partial mediating role.

In young individuals, both the disease and the drugs used for the treatment may impact fertility. Our study aimed to assess the action of new 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives of pyrrolo[3,4-d]pyridazinone on the rat testes in a model of TNBS-induced colitis in rats. Methods: In the current study, testes from eight randomly chosen rats were taken from each of the following groups: the control group (K), the colitis group (C), and the groups receiving compounds 7b, 10b, and 13b in higher doses (20 mg/kg). Results: Colitis did not affect the testicular index (expressed as a percentage of the body weight), but in group 13b, this parameter was significantly higher than in group K. No significant differences between groups were noticed in malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, interleukin-1, or metalloproteinase 9 levels. In the colitis group, lactate dehydrogenase activity in the testes was not increased; however, the administration of compound 10b significantly increased this parameter when compared to both groups K and C. Histological evaluation also did not reveal abnormalities, and the morphology of the testicular tissues was comparable in all groups. Conclusions: The results may suggest that the new 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives of pyrrolo[3,4-d]pyridazinone did not exert significant testicular toxicity.",

The results indicated that with increasing BGLSP content, the a* value, onset temperature, peak temperature, water absorption, development time, and dough stability all exhibited an upward trend in the flour blends and dough, while the L* value and protein network weakening decreased. When compared to the control sample, the inclusion of 10% BGLSP resulted in a reduction in the spread ratio, specific volume, cohesiveness, and springiness of CSB, while simultaneously increasing its hardness, chewiness, and gumminess. The observed odor variations among samples were primarily ascribed to the proportions of aldehydes and ketones. Notably, sensory evaluation demonstrated that the flavor attributes of BGLSP-enhanced samples were superior to those of the control sample. In conclusion, the incorporation of BGLSP at concentrations ranging from 0.5% to 1% is deemed optimal for CSB, offering novel insights into the application of BGLSP within the food industry.",

    "content": "Food safety is a significant global and local concern due to the threat of foodborne pathogens to public health and food security. Bacterial biofilms are communities of bacteria adhered to surfaces and represent a persistent contamination source in food environments. Their resistance to conventional antimicrobials exacerbates the challenge of eradication, driving the search for alternative strategies to control biofilms. Unconventional or \u201cgreen\u201d antimicrobial agents have emerged as promising solutions due to their sustainability and effectiveness. These agents include bacteriophages, phage-derived enzymes, plant extracts, and combinations of natural antimicrobials, which offer novel mechanisms for targeting biofilms. This approach aligns with the \u201cOne Health\u201d concept, which underscores the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health and advocates for integrated strategies to address public health challenges. Employing unconventional antimicrobial agents to manage bacterial biofilms can enhance food safety, protect public health, and reduce environmental impacts by decreasing reliance on conventional antimicrobials and mitigating antimicrobial resistance. This review explores the use of unconventional antimicrobials to combat foodborne pathogen biofilms, highlighting their mechanisms of action, antibiofilm activities, and the challenges associated with their application in food safety. By addressing these issues from a \u201cOne Health\u201d perspective, we aim to demonstrate how such strategies can promote sustainable food safety, improve public health outcomes, and support environmental health, ultimately fostering a more integrated approach to combating foodborne pathogen biofilms.",

The major constituent of the basement membrane is laminin, which exerts a remarkable repertoire of biological functions such as cell differentiation, migration, adhesion, and wound healing. Laminin performs its functions by interacting with two main classes of receptors, the integrin and the non-integrin laminin receptors, creating a complex network essential for tissue integrity and regeneration. Dysfunctional actions of laminin are the cause of diverse human diseases, including cancer, infectious, and neurodegenerative diseases. This topic has attracted researchers for some time, but the diversity of cell-surface receptors, through which laminin signaling occurs, makes the role of laminin controversial. Moreover, different laminin isoforms were identified, and each specific tissue basement membrane differs from the others in their laminin composition.

    "content": "ABSTRACTWound healing is a complex biological process encompassing haemostasis, inflammation, proliferation and matrix remodelling. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a pivotal role in regulating key events such as antimicrobial defence, platelet activation and angiogenesis. However, excessive ROS levels can induce oxidative stress (OS), disrupting the healing cascade and contributing to chronic wounds, inflammation and impaired tissue repair. Systemic conditions like diabetes, obesity, smoking and ageing further exacerbate OS, highlighting its clinical significance in wound management. Antioxidants (AOx), both endogenous and exogenous, have demonstrated therapeutic potential in mitigating OS, promoting wound closure and enhancing cellular recovery. Compounds like Vitamin E, curcumin, ferulic acid and resveratrol improve AOx enzyme activity, reduce oxidative damage and accelerate wound healing in multiple studies. Emerging evidence supports targeting oxidative pathways as a viable strategy to improve outcomes in chronic and systemic OS\u2010related conditions. This review explores the dual role of ROS in wound healing, the impact of OS in systemic diseases, and the therapeutic potential of AOx in fostering optimal healing outcomes, advocating for robust clinical trials to establish standardised interventions.",

However, the effect of Pro on fetal and placental development in gilts remains to be investigated, particularly in the context of obesity-induced impaired pregnancy. Here, we investigated the effect of dietary Pro on fetal and placental development in obese gilts. Exp.1: On day 60 of gestation, 48 gilts with similar delivery times were selected and followed up until delivery to determine the relationship between maternal obesity, litter performance, and Pro abundance in term placentae. The results showed that impaired reproductive performance was associated with body condition parameters and inadequate placental Pro availability of gilts. Exp. 2: A total of 114 gilts were then used in a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 factorial design to investigate the interaction between body condition (factor I: normal or obese gilts) and dietary Pro levels (factor II: low [0.89%, L-Pro], medium [1.39%, M-Pro], and high [1.89%, H-Pro]) on farrowing performance and placental angiogenesis. This resulted in six treatment combinations: normal-L-Pro, obese-L-Pro, normal-M-Pro, obese-M-Pro, normal-H-Pro, and obese-H-Pro. The effective number of replicates per group was 17, 21, 19, 21, 18, and 18, respectively (1 gilt per replicate). The results showed that increasing Pro intake increased piglet birth weight (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), litter weight (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), placental efficiency (P\u00a0=\u00a00.036) and placental vascular density (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and decreased the number of mummified fetuses (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), the rate of low-birth-weight piglets (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005), and the rate of invalid piglets (P\u00a0=\u00a00.029). Interaction effects were observed between body condition and dietary Pro levels on piglet birth weight (P\u00a0=\u00a00.046), within-litter birth weight variation (P\u00a0=\u00a00.012), and placental vascular density (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007). Moreover, the beneficial effect of Pro on farrowing performance may be related to the improvement of sirtuin 1-superoxide dismutase 2-mitochondrial reactive oxygen species axis homeostasis and angiogenesis in the placenta. Our results suggest that gestation diets need to provide adequate Pro to meet the needs of fetal and placental development, particularly in obese gilts.",

Furthermore, challenge tests and ex vivo assays revealed a deleterious impact of IR on individuals\u2019 metabolic flexibility, as reflected in blunted capacity to regulate homeostasis in response to hyperinsulinemia, at both systemic and erythroid levels.ConclusionsThus, we have demonstrated for the first time that metabolite alterations in erythrocytes represent reliable and sensitive biomarkers to disentangle the metabolic complexity of IR and childhood obesity.

Here, we term the capacity for such adaptation and restoration metabolic elasticity and model it through ad libitum-fasting-refeeding cycles. Metabolic elasticity is achieved by coordinate versatility in gene expression, which we call gene elasticity. We have developed the gene elasticity score as a systematic method to quantify the elasticity of transcriptome across metabolically active tissues in mice and non-human primates. Genes involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism show high gene elasticity; their elasticity declines with age, particularly with PPAR\u03b3 dysregulation in adipose tissue. Synchronizing PPAR\u03b3 activity with nutrient conditions through feeding-timed agonism optimizes their metabolic benefits and safety. We further broaden the conceptual scope of metabolic and gene elasticity to dietary challenges, revealing declines in diet-induced obesity similar to those in aging. Altogether, our findings provide a dynamic perspective on the dysmetabolic consequences of aging and obesity.",

We examined the associations of QUS measures, including stiffness index (SI) and T-score, with socio-demographic, lifestyle, and anthropometric correlates and risk of subsequent fracture. Methods: Calcaneal QUS was performed using GE\u2019s Lunar Achilles EXPII among 24,651 adults (mean age 59.5 years, 61.7% women) from the China Kadoorie Biobank study. Socio-demographic and lifestyle information was collected using an interviewer-administered electronic questionnaire, and anthropometrics were measured following standard protocols. Incidence of fracture and osteoporosis was recorded via linkage with nationwide health insurance database. Linear and Cox regression analyses were conducted, adjusting for potential confounders. Results: On average, men had higher SI (92.8 vs. 86.0) but lower T-score (\u22120.85 vs. \u22120.64) than women. In both men and women, advanced age and smoking were inversely associated with SI and T-score, while physical activity and tea drinking were positively so (p < 0.0001 for all). Except for height, all other anthropometric measures were significantly and positively associated with both BMD measures. With each SD lower SI, the risk of subsequent fracture was 26% (95% confidence interval: 10\u201344%) and 40% (25\u201357%) higher in men and women, and the corresponding associations of T-score were identical. Conclusions: Among Chinese adults, the SI and T-score provided by Achilles EXPII had similar patterns and predictive values for subsequent fracture, despite the T-score for men and women not being directly comparable because of gender-specific references used. Future studies are needed to confirm or refute the causality of relationship between lifestyle and anthropometric factors and BMD.",

Joinpoint regression was applied to assess long-term trends in the burden of KOA based on GBD 2021 data. The impact of population growth, aging, and epidemiological trends on the burden of KOA was examined through decomposition analysis. Additionally, an age-period-cohort analysis (APC) was conducted to assess the effects of age, period, and cohort on the burden of KOA in China. Finally, we predicted the burden of KOA in 2030 using the Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) and Norpred models.ResultsIn 2021, the number of patients with KOA in China was 10,957,472, reflecting an increase of 157.15% compared to 1992. Similarly, the incidence of KOA in China for the same year was 8,512,396, representing a rise of 123.45% since 1992. The and Years lived of disabled (YLDs) rate for KOA in China was 249.81 per 100,000 population, which is 116.44% higher than the rate observed in 1992. In 2021, the prevalence of KOA increased with age. Female exhibited higher estimates of prevalence, incidence, and YLDs than male across all age groups. Joinpoint regression analysis revealed fluctuating upward trends in prevalence, incidence, and YLDs, from 1992 to 2021. Decomposition analysis identified population growth as the primary driver of increased prevalence, incidence, and YLDs, particularly among female. Projections indicate that the number of KOA YLDs in China will continue to rise, potentially reaching a peak by 2030.ConclusionThe disease burden of KOA in China remains significant, necessitating increased attention, particularly for female and the middle-aged and older adult populations, in order to develop more targeted preventive measures.",

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticosteroids, opioids, etc., and surgical procedures, e.g. arthroplasty, are among the most common methods of treatment. There are reasons to believe that the gut microbiome (GMB) may influence inflammatory processes occurring in the pathomechanism of OA. The inflammatory processes occurring in the intestines may lead to disruption of tight junctions and increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in increased permeability of intestines, causing low-grade inflammation, including in the joints. Methods of altering the GMB composition to reduce the inflammatory and joint degenerative processes are known only to some extent, and long-term research is required.Osteoarthritis, a particularly well-known and very widespread disease due to the aging population, is characterized by moderate and local inflammation. It occurs due to the effects of biomechanical cartilage wear with damage of joint structures, primarily through degenerative processes. OA represents a therapeutic challenge, and any element that can influence its inhibition is highly sought after. Therefore, these methods seem to offer a promising additional approach to treatment.",

Metabolic comorbidities, particularly dyslipidemia, have been shown to influence the incidence and progression of KO. Given the potential impact of hypercholesterolemia on disease progression, the hypothesis arises that dyslipidemia treatments, such as statins, may offer a beneficial effect in mitigating KO progression.\u00a0Objective: This study evaluates the effect of statin therapy on the clinical improvement of knee osteoarthritis (KO), particularly in terms of pain reduction, measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).Methods: A cross-sectional, retrospective, descriptive, and analytical study was conducted at the rheumatology department of the University Hospital Center Hassan II of Fez, between January 2018 and January 2024. Patients diagnosed with symptomatic primary knee osteoarthritis (KO) were recruited from the department's database of rheumatology consultations, and all were regularly followed up within the department. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1, which received statin therapy, and Group 0, a control group that did not receive statins. The primary outcome was clinical improvement, which was assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to measure pain intensity.Results: A total of 465 patients were included, with 48 (10.3%) receiving statins. A significant clinical improvement in KO was observed in 34 (70.8%) patients in the statin group, compared to 196 (47.1%) patients\u00a0in the control group (p=0.001). The analysis indicated that statin use was significantly associated with clinical improvement, independent of other demographic and comorbid factors.Conclusions: Statin use may provide benefits in the management of KO, particularly in reducing pain, in addition to conventional symptomatic treatments. These results highlight the need for further prospective research to clarify the mechanisms of action of statins in this condition.",

This review examines the role of plant extracts in mitigating metabolic syndrome risk factors, addressing safety concerns and exploring associated technological advancements. The literature indicates that plant extracts hold promise for addressing the pathophysiology of metabolic dysfunction. However, challenges such as safety concerns, a lack of standardized regulation, and potential drug\u2013plant interactions currently limit their clinical application. Rigorous, long-term clinical trials are necessary to confirm the efficacy and safety of plant extracts before they can be established as a preventive strategy for managing metabolic syndrome.",

As reviewed herein, polyphenols, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate, epicatechin, and resveratrol, show in vitro and in vivo antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, and are particularly relevant in the context of AD, a leading cause of dementia globally. The olive oil industry, particularly in the Mediterranean region, produces significant amounts of waste, including leaves, pomace, and wastewater, which pose environmental challenges but also offer an untapped source of bioactive compounds. Despite promising in vitro and in vivo studies indicating that olive-derived polyphenols, such as oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol, may mitigate AD pathology, human clinical trials remain limited. The variability in extraction methods and the complex nature of AD further complicate research. Future studies should focus on standardizing the protocols and conducting robust clinical trials to fully assess the therapeutic potential of these compounds. This approach not only supports the development of new treatments for AD but also promotes environmental sustainability by valorizing olive oil industry waste.",

Recent statistics indicate a significant global impact, with 463 million adults diagnosed worldwide and this projected to rise to 700 million by 2045. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks pancreatic beta cells, reducing insulin production. Type 2 diabetes is primarily due to insulin resistance. Both types of diabetes are linked to severe microvascular and macrovascular complications if unmanaged. Microvascular complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, result from damage to small blood vessels and can lead to organ and tissue dysfunction. Chronic hyperglycemia plays a central role in the onset of these complications, with prolonged high blood sugar levels causing extensive vascular damage. The emerging treatments and current research focus on various aspects, from insulin resistance to the intricate cellular damage induced by glucose toxicity. Understanding and intervening in these pathways are critical for developing effective treatments and managing diabetes long term. Furthermore, ongoing health initiatives, such as increasing awareness, encouraging early detection, and improving treatments, are in place to manage diabetes globally and mitigate its impact on health and society. These initiatives are a testament to the collective effort to combat this global health challenge.",

We aimed to investigate the associations by using questionnaires and diaries, with adjustment for energy intake (EI) misreporting.MethodsThis cross-sectional study included 1047 Japanese adults aged 20\u201369\u00a0years. We used the Chrono-Nutrition Behavior Questionnaire (CNBQ) or 11-day diaries to assess chrononutrition behaviors (meal frequency, snack frequency, total eating frequency, timing of first eating occasion, timing of last eating occasion, duration of eating window, and eating midpoint) for workdays and non-workdays separately. Eating jetlag was defined as the eating midpoint difference between workdays and non-workdays. Diet quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index-2020, based on the Meal-based Diet History Questionnaire (MDHQ) or 4-day weighed food diaries. EI misreporting was evaluated using the Goldberg cut-off principle.ResultsUsing questionnaire data (CNBQ and MDHQ), we found inverse associations of snack and total eating frequencies, timing of last eating occasion, eating midpoint, and eating jetlag with diet quality (P\u2009<\u20090.05), irrespective of adjustment for EI misreporting. Also, we found positive associations of meal, snack, and total eating frequencies and duration of eating window with the prevalence of general obesity (body mass index\u2009\u2265\u200925\u00a0kg/m2), abdominal obesity (waist circumference\u2009\u2265\u200990\u00a0cm for males;\u2009\u2265\u200980\u00a0cm for females), or both; many of these associations were only evident (P\u2009<\u20090.05) after adjustment for EI misreporting. In contrast, using diary data, we found no associations between chrononutrition behaviors and diet quality, general obesity, or abdominal obesity, regardless of adjustment for EI misreporting (except for inverse associations of timings of first and last eating occasions and eating midpoint on workdays with diet quality).ConclusionsThe associations of chrononutrition behaviors with diet quality and obesity were dependent on the methodology used to assess these behaviors. Adjustment for EI misreporting radically changed only the associations with obesity in the questionnaire-based analysis. These findings suggest the importance of careful consideration of dietary assessment method selection and EI misreporting in chrononutrition research.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12937-025-01129-1.",

These imbalances not only contribute to cardiometabolic diseases but also play a significant role in cancer pathogenesis. The rising prevalence of obesity underscores the need to investigate dietary strategies for effective weight management for individuals with overweight or obesity and cancer. This European Society for the Study of Obesity (EASO) position statement aimed to summarize current evidence on the role of obesity in cancer and to provide insights on the major nutritional interventions, including the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), the ketogenic diet (KD), and the intermittent fasting (IF), that should be adopted to manage individuals with overweight or obesity and cancer. The MedDiet, characterized by high consumption of plant-based foods and moderate intake of olive oil, fish, and nuts, has been associated with a reduced cancer risk. The KD and the IF are emerging dietary interventions with potential benefits for weight loss and metabolic health. KD, by inducing ketosis, and IF, through periodic fasting cycles, may offer anticancer effects by modifying tumor metabolism and improving insulin sensitivity. Despite the promising results, current evidence on these dietary approaches in cancer management in individuals with overweight or obesity is limited and inconsistent, with challenges including variability in adherence and the need for personalized dietary plans.",

    "content": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is characterized by, among other things, dementia and a decline in cognitive performance. In AD, dementia has neurodegenerative features and starts with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Research indicates that apoptosis and neuronal loss occur in AD, in which oxidative stress plays an important role. Therefore, reducing oxidative stress with antioxidants is a natural strategy to prevent and slow down the progression of AD. Carotenoids are natural pigments commonly found in fruits and vegetables. They include lipophilic carotenes, such as lycopene, \u03b1- and \u03b2-carotenes, and more polar xanthophylls, for example, lutein, zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin, and \u03b2-cryptoxanthin. Carotenoids can cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and scavenge free radicals, especially singlet oxygen, which helps prevent the peroxidation of lipids abundant in the brain. As a result, carotenoids have neuroprotective potential. Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies, as well as randomized controlled trials, have mostly confirmed that carotenoids can help prevent neurodegeneration and alleviate cognitive impairment in AD. While carotenoids have not been officially approved as an AD therapy, they are indicated in the diet recommended for AD, including the consumption of products rich in carotenoids. This review summarizes the latest research findings supporting the potential use of carotenoids in preventing and alleviating AD symptoms. A literature review suggests that a diet rich in carotenoids should be promoted to avoid cognitive decline in AD. One of the goals of the food industry should be to encourage the enrichment of food products with functional substances, such as carotenoids, which may reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Olive trees (n\u2009=\u200950 per irrigation group) were irrigated with treated wastewater, spring water, and normal water, and the resulting oils were assessed for physicochemical properties, fatty acid composition, and bioactive compound profiles. Treated wastewater demonstrated distinct water quality characteristics, including elevated temperature (15.00\u00a0\u00b0C), chemical oxygen demand (COD: 58.38\u00a0mg/L), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5: 29.00\u00a0mg/L), ammonium (15.60\u00a0mg/L), nitrite (2.55\u00a0mg/L), suspended solids (14.00\u00a0mg/L), pH (7.40), and conductivity (2.80 \u00b5S/cm), reflecting residual organic material and ionic content post-treatment. Heavy metal concentrations in all water sources were within permissible limits for irrigation and drinking purposes, affirming their safety for agricultural use. Olive oil from treated wastewater-irrigated trees exhibited superior quality parameters, including low acidity (1.99%), low peroxide value (6.8 meq O2/kg), enhanced oxidative stability, higher fat content (96.5%), and favorable saponification values. Fatty acid analysis revealed a higher oleic acid content (62.6\u00a0mg/kg), known for cardiovascular health benefits. Bioactive compound analysis indicated significantly elevated levels of \u03b1-tocopherol (180.25\u00a0mg/kg), squalene (7500.8\u00a0mg/kg), carotenoids (25.1\u00a0mg/kg), and polyphenols (604.76\u00a0mg GAE/kg), contributing to increased antioxidant capacity (63.50% DPPH inhibition, a measure of free radical scavenging) and lower lipid peroxidation (0.25 TBARS, an index of oxidative degradation), indicative of superior oxidative stability. Spring water-irrigated oils showed higher acidity, peroxide values, and linoleic acid concentrations, alongside notable antibacterial efficacy against Escherichia.\u00a0coli, Pseudomonas.\u00a0aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus. aureus. Oils from normal water irrigation were characterized by higher linolenic acid levels, providing a more balanced fatty acid profile. These findings underscore treated wastewater\u2019s potential to enhance olive oil\u2019s nutritional and functional qualities, particularly its antioxidant activity and stability, while highlighting the role of spring water in enhancing antibacterial properties despite slightly reduced antioxidant stability. These findings are relevant to water-scarce Mediterranean and arid regions, informing sustainable irrigation strategies in line with global climate-resilient agriculture policies.",

This study investigates the in vivo antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects of EVOO on mice and rats. Materials and Methods. In this experimental study, using the acetic acid-induced writhing and formalin tests in mice, the analgesic effect of EVOO was evaluated. Acetylsalicylic acid and morphine were used as standard drugs, respectively. The anti-inflammatory activity was investigated by means of the carrageenan-induced paw edema model in rats using acetylsalicylic acid and dexamethasone as standard drugs. Last, the xenograft model in athymic mice was used to evaluate the anticancer effect in vivo. Results. EVOO significantly decreased acetic acid-induced abdominal writhes and reduces acute and inflammatory pain in the two phases of the formalin test. It has also a better effect than Dexamethasone in the anti-inflammatory test. Finally, the intraperitoneal administration of EVOO affects the growth of HCT 116 tumours xenografted in athymic mice.

It can mediate a series of cell biological processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis, migration, differentiation, and polarization. Accumulating evidence has verified that Chi3l1 is involved in diverse inflammatory conditions; however, a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the roles and mechanisms of Chi3l1 in almost all human body system-related inflammatory diseases is still lacking. The human body consists of ten organ systems, which are combinations of multiple organs that perform one or more physiological functions. Abnormalities in these human systems can trigger a series of inflammatory environments, posing serious threats to the quality of life and lifespan of humans. Therefore, exploring novel and reliable biomarkers for these diseases is highly important, with Chi3l1 being one such parameter because of its physiological and pathophysiological roles in the development of multiple inflammatory diseases. Reportedly, Chi3l1 plays an important role in diagnosing and determining disease activity/severity/prognosis related to multiple human body system inflammation disorders. Additionally, many studies have revealed the influencing factors and regulatory mechanisms (e.g., the ERK and MAPK pathways) of Chi3l1 in these inflammatory conditions, identifying potential novel therapeutic targets for these diseases.

However, the correlation of thyroid status with bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD), and osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF) is rarely discussed. The current study probes into the potential association between thyroid status and spinal BMC, BMD, and OVF from a novel perspective of thyroid function (TF) and sensitivity to thyroid hormone based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database. A total of 1844 participants were included in this study. The association of thyroid status with outcome variables, like spinal BMC, BMD, and OVF, was analyzed using thyroid function indices and sensitivity to thyroid hormone indices as influence factors. The correlation of them were assessed using univariate and multivariable weighted linear regression, weighted logistic regression models, restricted cubic spline model, and subgroup analyses. The results of this study showed that the association of free triiodothyronine (FT3)/free thyroxine (FT4) with BMC remained negatively associated after adjustment for all covariates. Higher thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing OVF in both unadjusted and adjusted models. In addition, the results of the restricted cubic spline model were consistent with the weighted multivariate regression analysis after adjustment. The results of this cross-sectional study showed that higher FT3/FT4 and TPOAb were associated with decreased spinal BMC and the increased risk of OVF, indicating a complex link between thyroid status and bone health. Therefore, patients with hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, autoimmune thyroid disease, or abnormal peripheral thyroid sensitivity, especially who with elevated TPOAb or FT3/FT4, should focus on the prevention of vertebral osteopenia, osteoporosis, and OVF.",

To assess the robustness of the outcomes, we performed a sensitivity analysis.ResultsOur two-sample MR analysis revealed an inverse causal relationship between cheese intake and several types of OA, including self-reported OA (odds ratio (OR) = 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.94\u20130.97, p = 6.70 \u00d7 10\u20137), OA of the hip or knee (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.48\u20130.72, p = 1.38 \u00d7 10\u20137), knee OA (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.42\u20130.66, p = 4.11 \u00d7 10\u20138), and hip OA (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.53\u20130.96, p = 0.0268). Additionally, the fixed-effects model also demonstrated a causal inverse association between cheese intake and OA, with a pooled meta-analysis OR of 0.95 (95% CI = 0.94\u20130.97, p < 0.0001).ConclusionsOur findings provided compelling genetic evidence of causal inverse associations between cheese intake and various types of OA, including self-reported OA, OA of the hip or knee, knee OA, and hip OA, which may enhance the efficacy of OA prevention by deepening our comprehension of the involved risk factors.",

DC datasets were analyzed for differential gene expression, WGCNA, and protein-protein interactions to identify key oxidative stress and ferroptosis genes. An SVM-RFE algorithm developed a diagnostic model, and ImmuCellAI analyzed immune infiltration patterns.ResultsMR analysis confirmed diabetes as a cataract risk factor and identified core genes related to oxidative stress and ferroptosis in DC. Four key genes (Hspa5/Nfe2l2/Atf3/Stat3) linked to both processes were discovered. Immune infiltration analysis revealed an imbalance associated with these genes.ConclusionsA functional interaction between oxidative stress and ferroptosis genes in DC is suggested, with a 4-gene model, indicating their potential as a \u2018bridge' in DC pathogenesis.",

These preventive strategies can be enhanced with routine implementation of comprehensive lifestyle modification, guideline-directed medical therapies, and creation of infrastructure that considers social determinants of health, ethnocultural variables, and financial challenges. In this synoptic review, scientific evidence sourced from Iran is analyzed to identify tactics to optimize the lifestyle medicine component of T2D care in Iran. Important evidence-based factors gleaned from the literature were curated into 9 categories: self-care, dietary adherence, mental health, self-comparison, transcultural adaptation, family support and community engagement, physical activity, the global pandemic, and service delivery. These categories were then assigned to 1 of 4 a priori aspects challenging diabetes care in Iran: behavioral factors, belief system, drivers, and implementation. By codifying discussion points and individual tactics, the improvement and optimization of T2D care in Iran can be facilitated. This reductionist model of approaching lifestyle medicine and complex chronic disease such as T2D can be applied to other ethnocultural populations.",

Started early, nephroprotection measures are able to prevent the degradation of renal function and are a major issue in CKD management. This approach consists of a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments aimed at slowing down the decline in renal filtration capacity and improving patient well-being. Drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and sodium\u2013glucose cotransport type 2 inhibitors play a crucial role in reducing intraglomerular pressure and renal inflammation. Their beneficial effects are potentiated when they are combined with non-pharmacological approaches, such as salt and protein restriction. This present review provides a critical overview of the current pharmacological and nutritional therapies that may slow down the progression of CKD. Recently, many pharmacological treatments have opened up new perspectives for managing this condition. Nevertheless, prevention remains the cornerstone of effective disease management. Actually, very few studies include both pharmacists and dietitians in their interdisciplinary team mainly represented by nephrologists, nurses, and social workers. However, their specific collaboration may significantly improve the knowledge and skills to help patients in their own CKD management. Future research is required to assess the benefit of collaboration in supporting patients with moderate-to-severe CKD before any concern of renal replacement therapy (RRT).",

Microgravity causes changes in blood redistribution, modulating vasopressin secretion, a major hormone controlling water reabsorption through the vasopressin-sensitive water channel AQP2. In this study, mice were hindlimb suspended over 4 weeks or rested in the ground as controls, and vasopressin levels, along with renal aquaporins expression were investigated. Copeptin, a stable precursor of the hormone vasopressin, significantly increased as early as 1 week of unloading which correlated with a significant increase in AQP2 total protein expression and decrease in serum osmolality, suggesting early activation of the vasopressin/AQP2 axis in this model. Conversely, in 4 weeks HU suspended mice, copeptin decreased significantly and both AQP2 mRNA and AQP2 total protein expression were significantly reduced. Consistent with a downregulation of the vasopressin/AQP2 axis an increase in serum osmolality was observed at 4 weeks HU. The basolateral water channels AQP3 and AQP4 were, on the other hand, unaffected. Immunolocalization studies confirmed reduced expression of AQP2 in renal collecting ducts of HU mice at 4 weeks. A significantly increased amount of the expressed AQP2 was found phosphorylated at Ser261, a site regulating AQP2 protein stability and degradation. In line, p38-MAPK, committed to phosphorylate Ser261 and to increase miR137 expression, an AQP2 mRNA-targeted microRNA, was significantly increased in HU, suggesting that reduced AQP2 expression was mainly due to increased protein degradation and downregulation of AQP2-mRNA translation. Our results suggest that vasopressin/AQP2 axis is upregulated as early as 1 week and may be involved in the antidiuretic response also observed in early spaceflight period in astronauts. Contrariwise, the vasopressin-AQP2 system is downregulated after 4 weeks HU, likely to counteract the persistent central venous pressure due to cephalic shift of fluids.",

This study aimed to assess toxic element levels in adults undergoing hemodialysis compared to a control group and to investigate the correlation between parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, uremic pruritus, anemia and toxic element concentrations. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 60 adult patients undergoing regular hemodialysis for at least three months. Another group of 60 apparently healthy adult voluntaries with matched age and sex with the patient group served as the control. The Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) method was used to measure the concentrations of serum levels of aluminum (Al), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), and arsenic (As) for both groups, as well as in drinking water and dialysate water. The hemodialysis group exhibited significantly higher levels of Al, Pb, Cd, Cr, and As compared to the control group. Serum Pb levels showed a significant negative correlation with PTH, while serum ferritin levels were negatively correlated with Cr. However, no significant correlation was found between toxic element levels and uremic pruritus or anemia. Toxic element concentrations in dialysis and drinking water samples were within acceptable limits and below the detection threshold set by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation/American National Standards Institute (AAMI/ANSI). Therefore, elevated toxic element levels in hemodialysis patients may not be primarily attributable to drinking water or dialysis.",

Some specific intestinal bacteria promote the occurrence and development of cancers under certain conditions. Conversely, some other specific intestinal bacteria suppress the oncogenesis and progression of cancers, including inhibiting the occurrence of cancers, delaying the progression of cancers and boosting the therapeutic effect on cancers. The promoting effects of the gut microbiome on cancers have been comprehensively discussed in the previous review. This article will review the latest advances in the roles and mechanisms of gut microbiome in cancer suppression, providing a new perspective for developing strategies of cancer prevention and treatment.",

However, many different populations of microorganisms that interact with each other to maintain homeostasis coexist inside the gut.

Intestinal viral communities, including bacteriophages, appear to influence health and disease, although their role has not yet been fully elucidated.

While the role of periodontal pathogenic bacteria is well recognized, the contribution of fungi and viruses, particularly Herpesviridae, remains controversial. Studies in adults have highlighted the presence of Herpesviridae, but evidence in pediatric subjects, especially systemically compromised, is limited. This systematic review aimed to assess periodontal status (e.g., health, gingivitis, periodontitis, necrotizing gingivitis, and/or periodontitis) and the subgingival and/or salivary microbial (bacterial, viral, and fungal) profile in systemically compromised pediatric (\u226418 years) subjects with gingivitis and/or periodontitis compared to clinical periodontal health. Methods: The review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024597695) and followed the PRISMA statement. Data from eight studies were descriptively analyzed and qualitatively assessed through ROBINS-I and JBI tools. Results: CMV was frequently detected, particularly in necrotizing gingivitis (19.40%). EBV was found in necrotizing gingivitis (20.69%) and periodontitis (10.34%); HSV was mainly associated with gingivitis and necrotizing gingivitis. Bacteria species in periodontitis included Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium, and Campylobacter species.

However, dysbiotic microbial communities may cause disruption of the symbiotic relationship between the host and the local microbiota, leading to the pathogenesis of various diseases, including viral infections and cancers. One of the most common infectious agents causing cancer is the human papilloma virus (HPV), which accounts for more than 90% of cervical cancers. In most cases, the host immune system is activated and clears HPV, whereas in some cases, the infection persists and can lead to precancerous lesions. Over the last two decades, the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology and bioinformatics has allowed a thorough and in-depth analysis of the microbial composition in various anatomical niches, allowing researchers to unveil the interactions and the underlying mechanisms through which the human microbiota could affect HPV infection establishment, persistence, and progression. Accordingly, the present narrative review aims to shed light on our understanding of the role of the human microbiome in the context of HPV infection and its progression, mainly to cervical cancer. Furthermore, we explore the mechanisms by which the composition and balance of microbial communities exert potential pathogenic or protective effects, leading to either HPV persistence and disease outcomes or clearance. Special interest is given to how the microbiome can modulate host immunity to HPV infection. Lastly, we summarize the latest findings on the therapeutic efficacy of probiotics and prebiotics in preventing and/or treating HPV infections and the potential of vaginal microbiota transplantation while highlighting the significance of personalized medicine approaches emerging from NGS-based microbiome profiling and artificial intelligence (AI) for the optimal management of HPV-related diseases.",

The final review included 33 genetic and transcriptomic studies and 23 interventional randomized clinical trials. The conducted systematic review highlights the important role of oxidative stress in the development of late complications in T2DM patients.

Consequently, we aimed to elucidate whether grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) administration recovers the CAF-induced hepatic antioxidant (AOX) misalignment and characterize the chronotherapeutic properties of GSPE. For this purpose, Fischer 344 rats were fed a standard diet (STD) or a CAF and concomitantly treated with GSPE at two time-points (ZT0 vs. ZT12). Animals were euthanized every 6 h and the diurnal rhythms of hepatic ROS-related biomarkers, hepatic metabolites, and AOX gene expression were examined. Interestingly, GSPE treatment was able to recover the diurnal rhythm lost due to the CAF. Moreover, GSPE treatment also increased the acrophase of Sod1, as well as bringing the peak closer to that of the STD group. GSPE also corrected some hepatic metabolites altered by the CAF. Importantly, the differences observed at ZT0 vs. ZT12 due to the time of GSPE administration highlight a chronotherapeutic profile on the proanthocyanin effect. Finally, GSPE could also reduce diet-induced hepatic oxidative stress not only by its ROS-scavenging properties but also by retraining the circadian rhythm of AOX enzymes.",

A patient diagnosed with PCa, presenting an initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 11.8 ng/mL, maintained PSA levels between 3.5 and 6 ng/mL for over 14 years with daily GE intake. To study GE\u2019s anti-proliferative effects and interactions with established therapeutics, healthy prostate epithelial cells (PNT2) and PCa cells (LNCaP, PC3, VCaP) were treated with GE. Proliferation, Integrin \u03b21 pattern, DNA-damage, as well as androgen receptor (AR) and Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) expression were investigated. GE reduced the proliferation of LNCaP and PC3 cells compared to healthy PNT2 cells but had contrary effects on VCaP cells. The combination of GE with standard therapies, including chemotherapy, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and Poly-(ADP-ribose)-Polymerase inhibitors (PARPi), reduced the efficacy of these treatments in tumor cells, potentially due to the GE-induced upregulation of the metabolic enzyme CYP2C9 in PCa cell lines. These findings indicate that while GE has anti-proliferative effects, the use of highly concentrated natural extracts must be carefully assessed by expert physicians on a case-by-case basis, especially when combined with established therapies.",

However, its efficacy and mechanism of protecting UVB-induced photodamage have not been studied. The research explores Allicin\u2019s protective roles and underlying mechanisms in UVB-induced photodamage of keratinocytes. UVB was employed to generate photodamage in the HaCaT cell line. DCFH-DA fluorescent and Biochemical analyses were carried out to evaluate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress on UVB-induced photodamage to HaCaT cells. RT-qPCR and western blot were performed to measure mRNA and protein expression. Allicin pretreatment (10 and 25\u00a0\u00b5M) improved cell proliferation and reduced apoptotic rates in UVB-induced HaCaT cells. Allicin (10 and 25\u00a0\u00b5M) inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) expressions (all, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Allicin reduced the intracellular ROS level and attenuated oxidative stress, with reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) level while increasing the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSh-Px) (all, P\u2009<\u20090.001) in UVB-induced HaCaT cells. Allicin pretreatment inhibited autophagy and reduced the protein expression of Beclin-1 while increasing the p62 protein expression (all, P\u2009<\u20090.001). We also observed that Allicin pretreatment reduced the NLRP3-related protein, such as Caspase-1 (P\u2009<\u20090.001) and increased the protein expressions of the PI3K/Akt pathway molecules, such as PI3K and Akt (all, P\u2009<\u20090.001).

With regard to equines, some studies are currently aimed at characterizing the intestinal microbial components and their stability, which can influence the psychophysical health and well-being in horses. The aim of this study was to analyze the fecal microbiota of 12 purebred Arabian horses by comparing microbial communities under two different management systems (Group 1 = box 22 h/day + paddock 2 h/day and Group 2 = paddock 24 h), while maintaining the same hay-based diet. This analysis also considers the growing interest in the relationship between breed and gut microbiota in equines. Fecal samples were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA V3-V4 amplicons. The management system did not influence the characteristics of the fecal microbiota in the subjects examined. The study of these characteristics in Arabian horses, with a strong aptitude for resistance exercises, could also contribute to the understanding of the relationships between intestinal microbiota and sports performance.",

It increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), imposing an economic burden on the healthcare system. However, the historical origins of MetS as well as the development and evolution of its definitions have not been conclusively documented in the literature. This study seeks to enhance the understanding of the developmental trends of MetS during the preceding two decades, placing particular emphasis on the definition, diagnosis and prevalence. Methods: An extensive search was performed from 1920 to 2023 across prominent scientific research engines, including Scopus, PubMed, MDPI, and others. Results: Despite advancements, many aspects of MetS remain inadequately understood. As the understanding of the nature and pathophysiology of MetS progresses, the development and refinement of its diagnostic criteria, and assessment and treatment guidelines will continue. Additionally, there exists significant variation in the global prevalence of metabolic syndrome, ranging from 14 to 39%. This prevalence is projected to increase due to the adoption of less healthy dietary patterns and sedentary lifestyles. The observed disparities in metabolic syndrome prevalence can be attributed to multiple factors, including demographic characteristics. Furthermore, the lack of a standardized definition across studies also contributes to the variation in reported prevalence rates. Conclusions: Further studies focusing on the standardization of the MetS definition across different research are crucial. The establishment of consistent criteria would enhance the reliability and validity of research findings, enabling more meaningful comparisons and interpretations.",

Diabetic animals showed evident alterations in biomarkers involved in the evolution of diabetic vasculopathy, marked by increases in biomarkers that favor vascular damage, which was between 1.5 and five times as many as those in non-diabetic animals, and a smaller number of biomarkers that protect against such damage (25\u201375% less than in healthy controls) was observed. The three oils administered decreased the concentration of biomarkers of vascular damage (35\u201345% in the serum lipid profile, 15\u201340% in early biomarkers of vascular inflammation and 20\u201360% in platelet aggregation and in thromboxane/prostacyclin imbalance). The greatest effect was by the antioxidant, both in the inhibition of lipid peroxidation and in the increase of glutathione. DDOO showed a significantly greater effect on oxidative stress and on thromboxane/prostacyclin imbalance than those shown by OSO and EVOO. This greater effect may possibly be explained by its higher triterpenoid content (913 mg/kg, compared to 113 mg/kg in OSO and 75 mg/kg in EVOO). We conclude, in the light of the results of this study, that these oils meet two basic conditions: they could improve the yield of the olive industry, and they equal, and may even increase, the beneficial effects of EVOO on cardiovascular disease.",

However, the comprehensive understanding of their medicinal potential has been hindered by the limitations of current research methodologies. Methods: This study focuses on the species Glenea cantor (Fabricius), which can produce several generations per year, and introduces a novel method using microwave carbonization techniques. By employing an in vitro coagulation test, UHPLC-MS, network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation, the hemostatic efficacy and mechanism of action of Glenea cantor charcoal medicine (GC-CM) were thoroughly studied. Results: In vitro coagulation tests showed that GC-CM significantly reduced the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT), indicating its ability to enhance the coagulation cascade and preliminarily confirming its hemostatic efficacy (p < 0.01 vs. blank control group). The analysis revealed that GC-CM comprises 453 components, including 137 bioactive components with high human utilization. After predictions via databases such as SwissTargetPrediction and deduplication, 215 targets linked to hemostatic specificity were identified. These targets regulate signaling pathways such as platelet activation, complement and coagulation cascades, and cGMP-PKG. Molecular docking demonstrated strong affinities between key targets such as SRC and PIK3R1 and compounds such as 2\u2032,6\u2032-dihydroxy 4\u2032-methoxydihydrochalcone, and 1-monolinoleoyl-rac-glycerol (binding energy < \u22125 kcal/mol).

Studies published in English, German or translatable to English using translation tools were included.Eligibility criteriaStudies of APN-led models of care in hospitals were included if they involved adult participants aged 18\u201364 years with multimorbidity (two or more chronic conditions) and/or complex chronic conditions and provided information on SOP, competencies or impact.Data extractions and synthesisData from full-text articles meeting the inclusion criteria were extracted independently by two reviewers, and a narrative summary was developed to present the results related to the objectives and questions of the study.ResultsA total of 2119 records were retrieved, with five studies ultimately included. The results included predischarge, postdischarge and bridging transition SOP. The competencies of APNs varied in both form and intensity, due to the heterogeneity of the APN-led models. Direct clinical practice competencies were most frequently described, especially regarding nursing or medical tasks, and shaped and influenced competencies in leadership, collaboration, guidance and coaching, and evidence-based practice. Indirect care activities were often mentioned. These studies indicated that APNs in APN-led care models positively impact clinical and patient outcomes, although high-intensity integrated care did not lead to cost reductions.ConclusionThe review aims to highlight the heterogeneity and current state of knowledge about the potential role of APNs in the integrated care of this increasing patient group in hospitals. The findings emphasise the significance of focusing on the unique needs of this patient population and may serve as a foundation for developing an APN-led model of care for this group in the clinical setting. However, further research is necessary to better elucidate the role of APNs within APN-led care models in relation to the care needs of this patient group.Trial registration numberOSF 4PM38.",

Results: Overall, 19% of university students were food insecure, with 2.5% experiencing moderate and 0.8% experiencing severe FI. Adjusted linear regression models showed that FI was associated with a higher body mass index (BMI), poorer self-rated health, and worsening health during the pandemic. SES mediated the relationship between FI and health outcomes, with the strongest mediation observed for BMI (indirect association: B = 0.25, 95% CI = \u22120.17\u20130.75; total association: B = 1.85, 95% CI = 0.14\u20133.56; 15.3% of mediation). Conclusions: FI is prevalent among UPV/EHU students, and it is associated with multiple negative health outcomes, partly explained by SES. To effectively address FI, higher education institutions should consider implementing comprehensive strategies. For future research, longitudinal studies would be recommended to systematically monitor FI and examine causal relationships.",

    "content": "ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the risk factors for surgical site infection (SSI) after percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) and evaluate the application value of the preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP)-to-albumin ratio (CAR) in predicting SSI.MethodsThis study retrospectively enrolled 329 patients with thoracolumbar compression fractures who underwent PKP in the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from January 2019 to June 2024. The demographic information, surgery-related data and laboratory examination results of the patients were collected. According to these results, the patients were divided into SSI and non-SSI groups, and the results were compared and analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the optimal cutoff value of preoperative CAR for predicting SSI, and binary logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate the predictive value of CAR for SSI. The risk factors of SSI in the thoracolumbar subgroup were further explored.ResultsThe study enrolled a total of 329 patients, and SSI occurred in 29 (8.81%). The optimal cut-off value of CAR was 0.1213, and the area under the curve was 0.808 (P < 0. 001). The results showed that SSI rates were related to the surgical site, and the SSI rate in the lumbar spine was higher than that in the thoracic spine. The SSI group had a longer surgical duration and more operated segments. The levels of preoperative CRP, CAR, procalcitonin and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were higher; however, serum albumin levels were lower. More patients had CAR \u22650.1213 (75.86% vs 25.33%) and white blood cell (WBC) >10*109 (27.59% vs 10.00%). In addition, no significant differences were found by the other demographic data and laboratory examinations between the two groups. In the binary logistic regression analysis, preoperative CAR was an independent risk factor for post-PKP SSI, and the SSI risk increased by 7.464 times in patients with CAR \u22650.1213. The number of operated segments, surgical duration, and ESR were also independent risk factors for SSI, whereas serum albumin is a protective factor.ConclusionPreoperative CAR is an effective predictor of post-PKP SSI, which can be used for clinical prevention and reduction of SSI risk.",

A weighted logistic regression analysis was employed for assessment of the correlation of DI-GM with NAFLD, and a restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was implemented to examine potential non-linear associations. Subgroup analyses were conducted to identify particularly susceptible groups. Additionally, the synergistic effects of different DI-GM components on NAFLD risk was assessed by weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression.ResultsThe DI-GM exhibited statistically significant correlation with NAFLD [OR (95%CI):0.91 (0.85, 0.98), p\u202f=\u202f0.015]. The results of the RCS analysis indicated a linear correlation of DI-GM and NAFLD (p\u202f=\u202f0.810 for non-linearity). Further stratified analyses indicated that the negative correlation of DI-GM with NAFLD were significant and consistent for all subgroups. The results of WQS regression revealed that soybean (27%), refined grains (17%), coffee (16%), and red meat (9%) had the highest contribution weights to NAFLD.ConclusionAs an important tool for assessment of the influences of diet on gut microbiota, DI-GM is negatively correlated with NAFLD risk factors. Soybean, refined grains, coffee, and red meat are key factors influencing NAFLD. The direct correlation of DI-GM with NAFLD shall be explored and the effectiveness of prevention and treatment of NAFLD shall be evaluated by improving DI-GM scores via dietary interventions.",

    "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing global health challenge, prompting increased attention on modifiable lifestyle factors that might influence disease progression. Among these, caffeine consumption has emerged as a potential protective factor, though the evidence remains complex and incompletely understood. This study aims to systematically review and evaluate the available evidence regarding the association between caffeine intake and AD progression. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across major databases including PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, covering studies from database inception through October 2024. The review included studies examining the relationship between caffeine intake and AD progression in human subjects, with quality assessment performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies and appropriate tools for other study designs. Findings indicated that higher caffeine intake (>200 mg/day) was consistently associated with a reduced risk of cognitive decline and AD progression. Plasma caffeine levels exceeding 1200 ng/ml were notably linked to a reduced risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. The Mendelian randomization study suggested a protective effect of genetically predicted higher plasma caffeine levels against AD, with an odds ratio of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.76-1.00), although this did not reach statistical significance. Overall, current evidence suggests a potentially protective role of moderate caffeine consumption against AD progression, particularly in individuals with MCI. The relationship appears dose-dependent and may be influenced by genetic factors and timing of exposure. Further research, particularly well-designed prospective studies and clinical trials, is needed to establish optimal dosing strategies and identify populations most likely to benefit.",

    "content": "Background/Objectives: Poland has remained one of the leaders in meat consumption in Europe for years. This study aimed to determine the relationship between Polish consumers\u2019 meat attachment and willingness to change their consumption habits to plant-based foods and meat, using self-assessment, including attitudes toward health, naturalness of food, product novelty, and willingness to seek information about these products. In addition, the relationship between the meat attachment of the surveyed individuals consuming plant-based meat alternatives and their attitudes towards these products was assessed. Methods: A representative survey with 1003 respondents was conducted using the CAWI (computer-assisted web interview) method. Four consumer clusters were identified using the k-means method: Meat lovers, Meat neutral, Meat attached, and Meat opponents. Results: The Meat lovers cluster was characterized by dominant values for entitlement and hedonism and the least willingness to consume plant-based products in the coming year. It was represented by those who care about their health and like product novelty while lacking familiarity with and willingness to try plant-based meat alternatives. The Meat opponents cluster was distinguished by having the highest readiness for eating plant-based products. These individuals valued the naturalness of food, disliked buying new food products, and were familiar with plant-based meat alternatives but consumed them occasionally. Furthermore, cluster membership differed after considering gender, education level, and place of residence. Conclusions: The findings indicate the need for educational and marketing activities to raise awareness of the health and environmental benefits resulting from reducing meat consumption to decrease meat attachment.",

While previously overlooked, there is now sufficient evidence that the RTM plays a crucial role in human health related to immune system training and protection against pathogens. Accordingly, dysbiosis or disequilibrium of the RTM has been linked to several communicable and non\u2010communicable respiratory diseases, highlighting the need to unveil its role in health and disease. Here, we define the RTM and its place in microbiome medicine. Moreover, we outline the challenges of RTM research, emphasising the need for combining methodologies, including multi\u2010omics and computational tools. We also discuss the RTM's potential for diagnosing, preventing and treating respiratory diseases and developing novel microbiome\u2010based therapies to improve pulmonary health.",

    "content": "Background:\u00a0Syzygium aromaticum is a tree whose aromatic dried flower buds are known as cloves. When it comes to phenolic chemicals, such as flavonoids, hydroxybenzoic acids, hydroxycinnamic acids, and hydroxyphenyl propane, clove is a major plant source of these substances. Finding out how effective clove buds are as antioxidants was the driving force behind this study\u2019s GC-MS investigation and computational discoveries. Methods: This inquiry into clove pods focused on the chemical composition of clove using the GC-MS technique, as well as its antioxidant qualities and computational modeling. Results: This antioxidant may be more effective in lower doses than ascorbic acid (A.A.), butylate hydroxytoluene (BHT), and \u03b2-carotene, with 57.22 \u00b1 0.41 mg QE/g of total phenols and flavonoids and 7.25 \u00b1 0.12 mg GAE/g of clove extract. Phenols destroy free radicals, which boosts antioxidant activity. Flavonoids defend against ROS, which also boosts antioxidant activity. Clove pod GC-MS analysis identified 21 components, of which eugenol accounted for 58.86%. The absence of nitrogen and chlorine molecules emphasizes the composition\u2019s organic nature. Eugenol, the major component of clove oil, is a phenolic molecule that binds strongly to bacterial enzymes such as DNA gyrase and dihydrofolate reductase. Docking experiments have shown that clove chemicals interact with acetylcholinesterase, a crucial enzyme in insect larvae, paralyzing and killing them. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the immense potential of plants in providing novel therapeutic and environmental solutions. We must support further research into nature\u2019s inherent benefits. The extensive knowledge that can be gained from botany can be used to improve health, ecology, and sustainability.",

    "content": "Abstract\u00a0In the context of protracted conflict, severe droughts and health system constraints, children under-five in Somalia face one of the highest mortality rates in the world. The WHO Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidance targets the main causes of morbidity and mortality, but adherence is low. We implemented the ALgorithm for the MANAgement of CHildhood illness (ALMANACH), a digital clinical decision support system, with the aim of improving IMCI adherence whilst promoting antibiotic stewardship in South-Central Somalia. Alongside, we evaluated health service delivery and ALMANACH acceptability and impact to inform design and roll-out. A pre-post assessment involving direct observation of consultations with sick children (2\u201359\u00a0months) based on the Demographic and Health Surveys Service Provision Assessment, complemented by exit interviews with caregivers and feedback from healthcare staff and stakeholders. Over 600 consultations were observed in each assessment period, in seven health facilities. ALMANACH had a significant impact on antibiotic prescription (reduction from 58.1% pre- to 16.0% post-implementation). This was particularly pronounced among certain conditions such as upper respiratory tract infections (30-fold reduction, RR\u2009=\u20090.03). Large differences in guideline adherence were observed (danger signs: 1.3% pre- to 99% post-implementation; counselling on follow-up: 12% pre- to 94% post-; and Vitamin A supplementation need checked: 19.9% pre- to 96.1% post-implementation). ALMANACH was found to be acceptable to caregivers, healthcare providers and stakeholders, with reports of positive impact on perceived quality of care. Implementation of ALMANACH in primary healthcare in Somalia significantly improved quality of care and guideline adherence, supporting the use of ALMANACH and similar tools to improve healthcare in fragile and resource-constrained settings.RESUMENEn un contexto de conflicto prolongado, sequ\u00edas severas, y limitaciones en el sistema de salud, los ni\u00f1os menores de 5 a\u00f1os en Somalia sufren una de las tasas de mortalidad m\u00e1s altas del mundo. La estrategia Atenci\u00f3n Integrada a las Enfermedades Prevalentes de la Infancia (AIEPI) de la OMS incluye recomendaciones alrededor de las causas principales de morbilidad y mortalidad, pero la adherencia a esta gu\u00eda es pobre. Implementamos el algoritmo para la gesti\u00f3n de enfermedades de la infancia ALMANACH (ALgorithm for the MANAgement of CHildhood illness), un sistema digital de apoyo para las decisiones cl\u00ednicas, a fin de mejorar el cumplimiento de la AIEPI durante un esfuerzo de promoci\u00f3n de la correcta administraci\u00f3n de antibi\u00f3ticos en el centro-sur de Somalia. De manera paralela, evaluamos la prestaci\u00f3n de servicios de salud, y la aceptabilidad e impacto de ALMANACH, para informar su dise\u00f1o y lanzamiento. Evaluaci\u00f3n antes-despu\u00e9s de la implementaci\u00f3n del algoritmo, derivada de la observaci\u00f3n directa de consultas m\u00e9dicas para ni\u00f1os enfermos (de 2 a 59 meses), basada en la Evaluaci\u00f3n de Provisi\u00f3n de Servicios (SPA, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s) de DHS (Demographic and Health Surveys, Encuestas Demogr\u00e1ficas y de Salud), complementada con encuestas de salida a los cuidadores, y retroalimentaci\u00f3n del personal de salud y partes interesadas. Se observaron m\u00e1s de 600 consultas en cada periodo de evaluaci\u00f3n, en 7 instalaciones de salud. ALMANACH mostr\u00f3 tener un impacto significativo en la prescripci\u00f3n de antibi\u00f3ticos (con una reducci\u00f3n de 58.1% antes de la implementaci\u00f3n, a 16.0% despu\u00e9s). Esto fue particularmente pronunciado con ciertas condiciones, como las infecciones de v\u00edas respiratorias superiores (ocurriendo 30 veces menos, RR\u2009=\u20090.03). Se observaron grandes cambios en la adherencia a las recomendaciones (atenci\u00f3n a signos de peligro: de 1.3% antes de la implementaci\u00f3n, a 99% despu\u00e9s; orientaci\u00f3n acerca del seguimiento: de 12%, antes, a 94% despu\u00e9s; y prueba de necesidad de vitamina A suplementaria: de 19.9%, antes, a 96.1% despu\u00e9s).

A total of 60 patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for AR who visited the outpatient department of our hospital from January to December 2022 were included. Patients were divided into treatment group and control group according to random number table method, with 30 cases in each group. The treatment group received immunomodulatory therapy, including allergen immunotherapy and immunomodulators. The control group received conventional treatment, including antihistamines (such as loratadine, 10\u2009mg oral daily) and steroid nasal sprays (such as budesonide, 1\u20132 times daily, 1\u20132 sprays per nostril). Basic information and disease severity were recorded 12 months after treatment began, and QOL scores and symptom scores were recorded. Rhinitis recurrences significantly reduced in the treatment group than in the control group (3.05 vs 8.26 times, P\u2005<\u2005.01). The duration of rhinitis attacks also significantly shortened in the treatment group than in the control group (2.22 vs 5.39 days, P\u2005<\u2005.01). The average QOL score (80.84 vs 60.85, P\u2005<\u2005.01) and happiness index (7.85 vs 5.17, P\u2005<\u2005.01) significantly improved in the treatment group than in the control group. The depression and anxiety scores of the treatment group (5.29 and 4.18, respectively) were significantly lower than those of the control group (8.42 and 7.79, respectively) (P\u2005<\u2005.01). The complication rate significantly reduced in the treatment group (3.5%) than that in the control group (8.2%) (P\u2005<\u2005.01). The long-term QOL of patients with AR improved after receiving immunomodulatory treatment. Rhinitis recurrences were decreased, duration of attacks was shortened, patient\u2019s happiness index was improved, depression and anxiety symptoms were alleviated, and incidence of complications was reduced. Therefore, immunomodulatory therapy has a positive long-term effect on the QOL of patients with AR.",

    "content": "Human hair dermal papilla cells (HHDPCs) play a significant role in hair growth. This study found that human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (UC-MSC-Es) effectively enhanced cell growth of HHDPCs. UC-MSC-Es has a size range of 30\u2013180\u2009nm and expression of CD9, CD63, CD81, CD73, and TSG101. UC-MSC-Es significantly increased cell populations of HHDPCs in the S and G2/M phases. UC-MSC-Es also increased the expression of cell cycle-related proteins, \u03b2-catenin, and cyclin D1. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that UC-MSC-Es promoted the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3\u03b2, and the inhibition of PI3K and Akt reduced the proliferative effects of UC-MSC-Es. Collectively, these findings suggest that UC-MSC-Es have a potential effect in treating hair loss through modulating PI3K and Akt-dependent pathways in HHDPCs.",

    "content": "BackgroundThis study aims to explore the associations between RBC folate, several serum folate forms [serum total folate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-mTHF), and unmetabolized folic acid (UMFA)], and obesity risk in middle-aged and older populations.MethodsData from NHANES (2011\u20132018) included 11,615 participants. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were applied to investigate associations of RBC folate and various serum folate forms with obesity risk after multivariable adjustment. Potential effect modifications were examined through stratified analyses and multiplicative interaction testing.ResultsAmong the total sample, middle-aged, and older participants, 4578 (39.4%), 3613 (40.0%), and 965 (37.2%) were obese, respectively. A positive association between RBC folate and obesity risk was observed, with the highest risks of obesity were consistently found in the fourth quartile (\u2265 1,430 nmol/L) for the middle-aged adults (OR = 1.104, 95% CI: 1.045\u20131.166) and the older participants (OR = 1.157, 95% CI: 1.036\u20131.293). A significant negative association between serum total folate levels and obesity risk in middle-aged participants, with an OR of 0.804 (95% CI: 0.773\u20130.835) in the highest quartile (\u2265 54.2 nmol/L). Similarly, serum 5-mTHF levels were negatively associated with obesity risk, with an OR of 0.800 (95% CI: 0.772\u20130.830) in the highest quartile (\u2265 51.2 nmol/L). Most importantly, older participants with UMFA levels in the fourth quartile (\u2265 1.06 nmol/L) had a higher risk of obesity (OR, 1.056; 95% CI: 1.004\u20131.110) compared with those with lower UMFA levels, but this association was not found in the total participants or the middle-aged participants.ConclusionSignificant positive relationships exist between RBC folate and obesity risk. Additionally, low serum 5-mTHF in middle-aged participants and high UMFA in older adults were associated with increased obesity risk, highlighting the importance of monitoring folate concentrations for guiding future clinical trials on folate supplementation.",

    "content": "This comprehensive review examines the crucial role of micronutrients in the health of children and adolescents, focusing on their growth and development. Micronutrients, including vitamins and trace elements, are essential for various biochemical processes and biological functions. We explored the roles, assessment methods, deficiency patterns, and intervention strategies for six essential micronutrients: iron, zinc, vitamin A, vitamin D, iodine, and folate. These nutrients were selected based on their fundamental importance in pediatric development. By analyzing the current literature from PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases, we synthesized findings regarding the impact of these micronutrients on health outcomes in children and adolescents, examining both regional and global prevalence data, with particular attention paid to Korean population data. This review provides evidence-based insights into the assessment and management of micronutrient status in children and adolescents and offers recommendations for clinical practice.",
